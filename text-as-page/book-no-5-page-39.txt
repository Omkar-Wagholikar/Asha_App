God gave us a mouth and two ears to communicate 
People failing to communicate create confusion, frustration and problems.  Communication is the exchange or two-way flow of information and ideas  between two or more persons. 
Communication  is the most important skill to fulfill your role as an  ASHA.  There are different forms of communication 

Verbal communication 

Non-verbal communication 

Written communication 
As an ASHA you need to use all three types of communication. 

Verbal communication 

This is the most common mode of communication used. Normally, we think  communication is completed once we have orally delivered the message. But  that is not true. Chances are that the message was not received properly. To  know if your message was received properly, ask the person whether she/he  understood the message and take feedback. In short, effective  communication is two-way. One-way communication is usually not effective.
