Wound can be of two types 

a. Without bleeding : Abrasions, small cuts etc.   b. With bleeding. 
Any wound requires immediate care. 

Following steps should be taken for wound care 

First clean the wound and the surrounding area with clean water. Use   different cotton swabs for each cleaning. 

Wipe away the dirt with cotton gently, but do not rub it. Rubbing   disturbs the clot and it can start bleeding again.  

Make a rectangular pad using cotton   between two layers of gauze. The   diagonal of the rectangle should   be one inch longer than the wound   itself. Ask your trainer to teach you   to make this.  

If the wound is dry, then it need   not be opened.  

For sharp cuts, stitches may be   needed. Usually simple stitching   of small injuries can be done   at nearby health facility. Such persons need to be sent to health   facility.
