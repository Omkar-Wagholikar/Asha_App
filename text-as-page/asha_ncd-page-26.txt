Helping people make healthy food choices 

The following points will help you to explain healthy food choices to your community. 

l
  Consume a variety of fresh, seasonal and locally available fruits and vegetables   (including green leafy vegetables).  

l
  Eat whole cereals and pulses (with outer covering) as they are high in fibre or roughage   than refined cereals and pulses (without outer covering). Fibre/roughage helps in   slowing down the absorption of sugar and fats into the blood. 

l
  Avoid eating processed foods or foods available in packets - these have high amount   of fat, salt and sugar.  

l
  Try to include foods from each of the four basic food groups shown in the table of   food group classification. 

l
  Eat whole fruits as they are rich in natural fibre or roughage. 
An unhealthy diet during pregnancy increases the risk of premature delivery,   low birth weight and birth defects. Such babies are more prone to develop Non-  Communicable Diseases as adults. 

Effects of an Unhealthy Diet 

Overweight 
Heart   Diseases   and Stroke 
Tooth Decay   and    Gum Diseases 
High Blood   Sugar Levels  High Blood   Pressure 
Inability to fight   infections, risk   of catching   more infections 
Certain   Cancers 
Such changes in the diet are not only applicable to rural areas but also to urban areas,   where intake of processed foods has increased because of the lack of easily available   fruits and vegetables. The cost of vegetables and fruits has also risen. Ready-to-eat and   packaged foods are hard to resist and easily available everywhere. Sometimes they are   cheaper and easier to make when compared to healthy/fresh foods.
