Find the point on the chart where the line for the childs weight meets the   line for the childs age. 
Decide where the point is in relation to the curves:  If the point is below the bo om most (-3SD) curve, the child is severely   underweight. 
If the point is between 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 curve or exactly on the 3
rd 
curve, the   child is moderately underweight.  
If the point is on or above the curve marked zero or between the curve   zero and -2SD (second curve) or exactly on the 2
nd
 curve, then the child is   normal. 

Community Level Care for a Malnourished Child  
All children who are underweight, should receive the following: 
1.  Nutritional counselling as discussed earlier  
2.  Prompt treatment for all illnesses  
3.  Periodic weight measurement to ensure weight gain and detect worsening   early.  
(a)  De-worming tabs (Albendazole): Half tablet of albendazole for a child less   than two years old and one tablet for all children above two.   (see Annexure-6) 
(b)  Paediatric Iron and Folic Acid Tablets: Daily one for three months.  
(c)  A dose of Vitamin A: If this has not been given. 
Remember:  
Those children who are moderately underweight, should   be taken to a 24X7 PHC or higher facility for a medical   consultation. Children who are severely malnourished need   prompt hospitalisation in a centre which manages such   children. This is o en the District Hospital.
