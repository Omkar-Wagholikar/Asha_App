Alcoholic husbands exploit women in several  ways. They treat their family member  harshly everyday to show off the  manhood. It makes women’s already  difficult lives all the more miserable. 
There are fewer amenities for toilets for  women. In the village, they have to go to  answer nature’s call either early morning  or evening. 
Villages may have no air pollution, but that is not  true for women. They work in kitchen smoke for 4-5 hrs everyday. It gives  them coughs and headaches. 
And do you know, still they are hardy enough to live longer than men. If  they get the justice in our families and villages, they will be healthier still. 

What we can do 
Let women also take part in making decisions in the family and village. They should  participate in all meetings. This will make decisions wiser and more practical. 

Discuss with men to share domestic work and child care. 

Encourage Women to eat well and take enough rest. 

Encourage girls to go to higher school and learn. 

Try to stop physical or mental abuse of women. 

Do not ignore women’s health complaints. 

Raise your boys and girls with equal respect and love. 

Let us think about it 

Pregnancy and Child care can be shared by the couple. 

Is it right to sex-select babies like some people do? Can our world be  without women? 

Women and men are born equal. There are many goddesses in our  mythology. Then how can we ill-treat and abuse women? 

Why men don’t come forward to accept contraception?
