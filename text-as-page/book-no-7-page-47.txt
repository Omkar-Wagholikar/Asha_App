Women’s Reproductive Health

It is harder for a woman to protect herself from STIs, because she is o� en   unable to negotiate with the male partner to use a condom. 

What are the consequences of STIs? 
STIs can cause:   infertility in men and women;  
babies to be born too early, too small or blind; and  
long lasting pain in lower abdomen, or even cancer. 
Death from severe infection or AIDS 

What are the signs of RTIs? 
Signs of RTIs include:  Abnormal discharge  
Lower abdominal pain  
Rash, Swelling in the groin or sore in genital area.  
However, these signs manifest very late. It is best to be aware that a woman   can be at risk for an STI if:  Husband has signs of an STI. 
Either the man or woman has more than one sexual partner.  
In some occupations which require long period of travel and where the   men engage in casual sex.  

Tasks for ASHA to be involved in are: 
Counsel women at risk on preventive measures. 
Counsel women with symptoms of RTI/STI to go to the health facility for   treatment. All 24X7 PHCs or higher facilities are equipped and skilled to   provide necessary care. 
Take the course of medicine fully (all courses are for a week or ten days).   You should motivate the woman to complete the course of medicines. Not   completing the course of medicines makes the bacteria resistant and can   cause a worse infection that does not respond to drugs the next time. 
Ensure that the husband also gets treated. 
Counsel a women to abstain from sexual activity during the period of   treatment. 
If the husband is known to indulge in extra-marital relationships, counsel   the woman to avoid having unprotected sex. 

Where to get treatment for RTI/STI 
All drugs for STI treatment are available free of cost from PHC upwards. 
ANM and the PHC doctor can provide treatment.
