Risky sexual behaviour 
The main cause of HIV-AIDS spread is risky sexual behaviour. Sex with multiple  partners without condom is the risky sexual behaviour. Men having sex with  men also exposes them to risk of infection. 

The window period 
After exposure to risky situations, HIV test will be positive only after 6-12  weeks. This is the window period. So one has to wait for this period to get an  HIV test. 
In our country more than 85 percent of HIV transmissions take place through  sexual route. There are not high risk groups but there are some people who  have high risk behaviour. AIDS can strike anybody depending on your behaviour. 

AIDS is the illness 
AIDS is the illness due to HIV infection. This may take months and years after  HIV test is positive. The person is infective in this period. AIDS is a serious  disease without permanent cure. But now we have some medicines to reduce  its severity. Suggestive symptoms of AIDS: 

Continuous weight loss, 

Persisting diarrhoea, 

Repeated fever illness lasting more than one month. 

The minor features include chronic cough, itching, rash on body and  genitals, oral thrush (fungal infection), buboes, and illnesses coming  too often.
