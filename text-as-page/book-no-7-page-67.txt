Your Role in the Treatment Phase  
You could serve as the DOTS provider in your village   and ensure compliance.  
Since the treatment is of long duration, the ASHA has   a key role in motivating the patient to complete the   treatment and prevent them from stopping midway or   drop out.  
Recognising the side-eﬀ ects of the drugs (Annexe 8)   and knowing how to deal with side-eﬀ ects of drugs   and making sure of drug availability at the health   facility will help you to do this more eﬀ ectively.  
Encourage the patient to take suﬃ  cient nutrition   during treatment and moderate rest at least for the ﬁ rst   two months. 
The family of the patient should be counselled to take precautions at   home especially for children and elder persons who can contract the   disease quickly. 
The patient must eat and drink from a separate set of utensils which   should be washed separately. When coughing, the patient must put a   protective clean cloth over his mouth to prevent spread of droplets or   leave the house and cough in a nearby open space. The cloth should be   washed in hot water or with disinfectant thoroughly on a regular basis.  
The patient should not have close contact with spouse, children and   infants and the elderly within the family at least for two months a� er   starting treatment. Simple hygiene precautions will help in preventing   transmission of TB within the family. 
You must keep a watch on the other family members to detect early signs   of TB in the members and if necessary, get them examined from time to   time. 
Ensure BCG vaccination of children at birth. This can help prevent TB   among small children. 
TB is also a stigmatising disease. Conﬁ dentiality of patient identity must   be maintained.  
Awareness of TB related symptoms and the approach to achieving a cure   through self-reporting for examination must be stressed at community   gatherings as also the importance of good nutrition and taking of   complete treatment.
