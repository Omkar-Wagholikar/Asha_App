3. Update on  Immunisation 

This session has already been covered in the ASHA Module 2. Thus, this is   only a recapitulation.   
Objectives of the session 
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about:  
Learn the skill of bene ciary tracking: listing the names and knowing   when the next dose is due. 
Learn the skill of ensuring that the childs immunisation record is   updated. 
Learn which children are at risk of being excluded from the programme   and how to ensure complete coverage.  

Role of ASHA in Immunisation 
(a) Make a list of pregnant women, newborns and   children up to two years eligible for di erent vaccines. 
(b) Visit all families once in six months  at least to update   this list. A er every immunisation session (VHND)   update both the village register and the childs health   card. Learn how to  ll this village health register and   child health card. You must be able to do this and   teach this on your own.  
(c) Ensure that immunisation is discussed during every   home visit in homes where there is a child under one   year of age.
