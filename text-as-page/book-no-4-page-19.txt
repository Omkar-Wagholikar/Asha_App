Dog and animal bites: Will it be rabies? 
Dog bite is greatly feared because it can give rise to a deadly illness,   which is called rabies. This is an illness, which affects the brain. The   victim fears water. This is due to severe spasm during swallowing. No   cure is available for rabies. Anti Rabies Vaccine (ARV) immediately after   the dog bite can prevent the fatal illness. These vaccines are available in   government hospitals.  
Not all dogs are rabid. Germs are present in the saliva of infected dogs.   Some dogs get the infection from wild animals such as wolf or tiger. The   infected dog passes it on to the other dogs. All infected animals finally   die and may infect others in the meantime. Controlling stray dogs is the   key to prevent rabies. Monkeys and other animals can also be infectious   if they are rabid due to such bites. 
Very effective and simple first aid for   any dog bite is to: 

Wash the wound with soap and water   thoroughly. This is most important.  

Do not disturb the wound. Leave   it open. Tie a loose dressing and   advise to consult doctor/other staff   in hospital.
