Consider timing 
There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those  situations where there is a high degree of anger on either side, a  preoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or tiredness on one  side or the other. The best outcome for almost all negotiations is a win/win  situation when both parties walk away with a positive feeling about having  achieved their goals. 

Suggestions for Effective Negotiation 

While negotiating as an ASHA you must have unlimited patience. Never try to  make the opponent feel low and defeated. Emphathise with the other person  to understand her/his perspective. 
Be positive and open in your approach. Do not begin the discussion with any  set assumptions or negative feelings. Approach a negotiation with an attitude  of, “I accept you as an equal negotiating partner and respect your right to  have an opinion of your own.”You may think that this is being soft and not  effective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence.
