We can also create immunity against some germs. We give babies vaccines to  make them stronger against some illnesses. Complete immunization in time  prepare body to fight against germs of certain diseases. 
For many germ illnesses, we use medicines. TB, malaria, and leprosy are some  illnesses we can cure with medicines. 
But some illnesses like hydrophobia; AIDS, etc are without effective cure. These  small germs are called viruses. Recently AIDS has some good medicines though  no permanent cure is possible. 

Think about this 

How can we increase our resistance to illnesses so that we do not fall ill? 

Why we not see the small pox these days? 

Do you come across about hydrophobia patient in your village? Why are  people so afraid of a dogbite?
