What is an Unhealthy Diet?  

In the last few years, there have been changes in the lifestyle of people in India in rural and   urban areas. Improved economic growth and status among some people has led to dietary   changes. Increasing poverty levels have also led to changes in peopleâ€™s eating habits. 
People have shifted from consuming traditional and fibre-rich foods like whole products   - wheat (atta products), jowar, bajra, maize, unhusked dals (with outer covering), fruits   and vegetables towards eating more processed foods like - white rice, maida, husked dals   (without outer covering), foods of animal origin, foods available in packaged forms which   are ready-to-eat and cook, etc.  
A diet rich in sugar, salt, fat, foods such as red meat - mutton, liver; milk and milk products   such as full cream milk, butter, ghee, but  low in the amount of  fruits and vegetables is   called an Unhealthy Diet.  
It is important however, to remember that healthy eating is not only the type of food   consumed. It also refers to the way food is prepared and consumed. Food prepared with   excess of fats, sugar, salt, or consumption of refined foods, ready-to-eat and packaged   foods are all risk factors causing NCDs.
