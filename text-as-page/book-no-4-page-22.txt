Burns are common injuries in India and women are the common   victims.  
In some cases, the pressure stove is the culprit. In others it can be gas   leak from the cylinder. 
Children or women may suffer scalds due to spilling of boiling liquids   — like milk, oil, dal, chai etc.  
Please note that some of the burn cases can be suicide attempts or   attempt to murder. In any case, our priority should be to give first aid   and take the person to hospital at the earliest. Inform the doctor about any   information by the woman on the burn injury being intentional. In case, you   know, do let her know about NGOs or counsellors she can approach for help.   As necessary, the doctors will initiate legal measures in these cases.
