As an ASHA there are Some Key Principles that You Need  to Keep in Mind in Activism to Bring about Change 

1. Identify and work on the issues that are most crucial and urgent and are  affecting the larger community. 
2. Involve the people who are affected and ensure that they cooperate with  you. 
3. Let it be a peoples movement and struggle rather than an individual effort 
4. Mobilising the community takes time and will be energy consuming. Do not  lose patience and hope.
