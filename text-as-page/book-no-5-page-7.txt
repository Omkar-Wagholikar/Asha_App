As a woman you must have experienced that you are expected to be humble,  to put your needs after that of other people, to learn to say “yes” all the  time to others’ requests, to please everyone so as to feel valued and to seek  constant approval. 
This is a hard pattern to break. However, now that you have started your  journey as an ASHA you need to first identify your own needs in order to be  able to understand and appreciate the needs of others. 

Let Us Understand the Meaning of Self-Esteem 

Self-esteem refers to the perception that  you have about  yourself.  It is about  how much  you  value  yourself  and  how  important  you  think  you are. 

It is about being confident about and satisfied with your own self. 

It is about a reasonable sense of your self-worth. 

It is about having faith in yourself and your abilities. 

It is about being pleased with yourself and with your achievements. 
Remember, it is NOT about 

Convincing yourself that you are of value 

Feeling confident or feeling good when other people praise you 

Having beautiful features 
Let us examine the characteristics of a person with healthy self-esteem: 

Self-confidence 

Ability to express true feelings 

Ability to recognise and value own accomplishments 

Ability to forgive self and others 

Ability to welcome change 
If you do not take care of yourself, respect who you are and respect your own  needs, you will not be able to take care of others and respect their needs. 
Give some time to know yourself. There is a need to go through the process  of self-realisation. It will help you to build up a healthy self-esteem. 
Maintain a diary about your dealing with others and yourself during the day. 
The process of understanding the self and self-realisation is continuos and one  needs to do it systematically.
