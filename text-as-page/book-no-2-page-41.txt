Measuring fever in adults 
It is wise to take a sick persons temperature even if   she/he does not mention about having fever. Touch   your own forehead and the persons forehead with   both sides of your hand. If the persons forehead   is warmer than yours, she/he may have fever. This   is a simple way to find out if someone has fever   or not.  

Thermometer is used for measuring temperature 

  Take a simple oral thermometer and shake it well.   See that its mercury mark is below normal (36C   or 98.4F). Do not hold or touch the bulb of the   thermometer. Hold the thermometer by the bigger   end with no mercury because mercury line will go up   and you might get a wrong reading. 

Put the thermometers bulb end under the tongue in   the patients mouth or armpit for two minutes. 

The oral temperature is a bit higher than the armpit.  

Take it out to see closely while turning it slowly. 

Record the temperature of a sick person. Is it more than   36C/98.4F? 

Temperature of 37C39C is mild fever. 

Between 39C and 40C is moderate fever.  

Above 40C it is high fever (refer any person with high fever after   sponging and tablet Paracetamol).  

Clean it with water after each use. 

For your information, thermometers have mercury inside which is toxic   and hence adequate care should be taken when used for children. 

Treating Fever 

General treatment 

Mild fever generally needs no treatment unless we are thinking of   some infections like malaria, TB, pneumonia etc. 

For moderate fever Paracetamol tablet is the best treatment. One   tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. For more details see table
