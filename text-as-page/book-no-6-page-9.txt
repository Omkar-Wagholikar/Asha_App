2. Activities of an ASHA  

ASHAs work consists mainly of  ve activities: 
1.  Home Visits:  For two to three hours every day, for at   least four or  ve days a week, the ASHA should visit the   families living in her allo ed area. Home visits should   take place at least once in a month if not more. Home   visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive   care. Over time, families will come to her when there is   a problem and she would not have to go so o en to their   houses. Meeting them anywhere in the community/  village is enough. However, where there is a child   below two years of age or any malnourished child or a   pregnant woman, she should visit the families at home   for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the   house, a series of  ve visits or more becomes essential.  
2.  A ending the Village Health and Nutrition Day   (VHND):  On one day every month, when the Auxiliary   Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide immunisation   and other services in the village, ASHA will promote   a endance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM   services and helps with service delivery.  
3.  Visits to the health facility:  This is usually   accompanying a pregnant woman or some other   neighbour who requests her services for escort. The visit   could also be to a end a training programme or review   meeting. In some months, there would be only one visit,   in others, there would be more. 
4.  Holding village level meeting  of womens groups, and   the Village Health and Sanitation Commi ee (VHSC),   for increasing health awareness and to plan health   work. 
5.  Maintain records  which would make her more   organised and make her work easier, and help her to   plan be er for the health of the people. 
The  rst three relate to facilitation or provision of healthcare   and the last two are supportive and mobilisational   activities.
