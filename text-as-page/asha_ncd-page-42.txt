What is Diabetes? 

All food that we eat is broken down into a sugar called glucose.   Glucose is carried by the blood to all the parts of the body to give   energy. The hormone which helps glucose move from the blood   into the cells, is called INSULIN.  
Insulin helps to keep the blood sugar levels normal. In diabetes, the   body does not produce insulin or cannot use the insulin properly.   The glucose builds up in the blood, resulting in high blood glucose   levels.
