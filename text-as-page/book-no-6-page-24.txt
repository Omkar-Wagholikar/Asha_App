Facts about Antenatal Check-up 

How many antenatal check-ups? 

Four antenatal visits must be ensured, including registration within the first   three month period. The suggested schedule is as below: 
1st visit:   Within 12 weeks—preferably as soon as pregnancy is suspected—  for registration of pregnancy and first antenatal check-up 
2nd visit:  Between 14 and 26 weeks 
3rd visit:  Between 28 and 34   weeks  
4th visit:  After 36 weeks 
It is advisable for the pregnant   woman to visit the Medical Officer   (MO) at the PHC for the third   antenatal visit, as well as availing   of the required investigations at   the PHC.
