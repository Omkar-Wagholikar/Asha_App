Simple Skills that Save Lives 
22 

Fever is a common problem among young children. A child with fever may have   malaria or another disease such as simple cough or cold or other viral infection.  

ASK: Does the child have fever?  
Ask the mother if the child has fever. To check   temperature, place the thermometer in the armpit   for 2 minutes.   
If you do not have a thermometer, place your hand   on the tummy of the child to decide if the child   feels hot to touch.  
Fever is present if the mother is sure that her child   has had fever, measured by the thermometer, or   if you have determined that the child feels hot to   touch. 

5. Assessing and Classifying Fever 

ASK: For how long? If more than seven days, has fever   been present every day?  
Ask the mother how long the child has had fever. If the fever   has been present every day for more than seven days, refer this   child for further assessment.  

LOOK or FEEL for stiff neck.  
A child with fever and stiﬀ  neck may have meningitis. A   child with meningitis needs urgent treatment with injectable   antibiotics and referral to a hospital.  
While you talk with the mother during the assessment, look   to see if the child moves and bends his neck easily as he looks   around. If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not   have a stiﬀ  neck.  
If you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw   the child’s a� ention to his umbilicus or toes. For example, you   can shine a ﬂ ashlight on his toes or umbilicus or tickle his toes   to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can   bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes.
