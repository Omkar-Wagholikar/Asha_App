In the earlier chapters, you learnt about your specific role related to several disease   conditions. In this chapter, you will learn what tasks are expected of you in the screening,   prevention and control of common NCDs. You will find that many points that have been   highlighted are repeated here, but this will help you to understand and plan your day to   day work.  
In order to provide community level care, you will continue to use Home Visits, the Village   Health Nutrition Day (VHND), and meetings of Village Health Sanitation & Nutrition   Committee (VHSNC). The main difference now is that your role will now expand to reach   all adults of 30 years and above. 
The ASHA facilitator and ANM will support you in household visits, conducting   community health promotion activities, and follow up, particularly among those who are   not regular with the treatment or are not making required lifestyle changes.

1. Listing 

So far you have made lists of pregnant women, new-borns, children, and eligible couples,   so that you can ensure that they receive services that they require. For NCDs you will now   also make lists of those women and men in your community who are of 30 years and above,   so as to ensure that they are screened for NCDs and undertake follow up. You will continue   to ensure that you reach the most marginalised as well as those who migrate into your area,   so that they are also part of the screening and follow up process.
