Mandookparni fried in ghee is also indicated to increase   the RBC. Therapeutically, use of Punarnnavadi mandura with water or   buttermilk is indicated for minor and moderate anaemia. Anaemia in girls   is a common cause for amenorrhoea. Therapeutically use of Rajapravartini   Vati 500mg. two tabs per day upto the onset of menstruation is beneficial   in the condition.
