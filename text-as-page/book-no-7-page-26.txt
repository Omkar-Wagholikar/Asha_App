Prevention of Diarrhoea 
Good hygiene practices and use of safe drinking   water also protect against diarrhoea. Hands   should be thoroughly washed with soap and   water a� er defecating and a� er contact with   faeces, and before touching or preparing food or   feeding children.   
To prevent diarrhoea, all faeces, including those   of infants and young children, should be disposed of in a latrine or toilet or   buried.  If there is no toilet or latrine, adults and children should defecate   away from houses, paths, water supplies and places where children play.     Faeces should then be buried under a layer of soil. Human and animal faeces   should be kept away from water sources. In communities without toilets   or latrines, the community should consider joining together to build such   facilities. Households can be encouraged to build their own toilet. 
Step 1: Identifying the nature of diarrhoea  Duration: Ask the mother if her child has diarrhoea. Passing stools more   than three times a day is diarrhoea. Usually it is watery.  
If the mother says the child has diarrhoea: Ask for how long the child has   had diarrhoea. If the  diarrhoea is of 14 days or more  duration, the child has   severe persistent diarrhoea . This child should be referred to hospital.  
Passing Blood: Ask if there is blood in the stools. The child who is passing   blood in the stools has  dysentery . This child also needs referral. But one   can start treatment at home also, especially if the access to a doctor is not   immediately possible. The child should be treated with Cotrimoxazole at   home (dosage as Annexure 6) and the mother should be advised home care. 
Step 2: Assess every child with diarrhoea for dehydration.   Look at t h e child’s general condition. Is the child lethargic or unconscious?   Is the child restless and irritable?  
Look for sunken eyes.
