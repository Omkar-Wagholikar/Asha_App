ASHA as a  Health Activist 

Your role as an activist to improve the access of marginalised and  disadvantaged community members to public health care services is very  important. Before we discuss your role in detail, let us visualise a situation. 
Rami lives next to your house. She is five months pregnant. She is very weak,  but has not registered her name with the ANM. Rami does not receive any  healthcare services. Her husband is a drunkard. Everyday he drinks and shouts  at Rami, sometimes even beats her. 
You feel uncomfortable and want to stop this. You discuss this with other  women in your neighbourhood. They understand your point of view. Together  you decide that if Rami’s husband creates problems, all of you will collectively  go and stop him. 
You all manage to do so. You inform Rami’s husband that if this happens  again, you would inform the police. 
Next day when the ANM (Auxilliary Nurse Midwife) comes, you take Rami with  you and register her name. 
Well, admittedly a real situation does not get handled this smoothly, but you  will never know just how it will fare unless you try it out. You need to take  the first step towards bringing about change. Initially you will be alone but  slowly, with your efforts of creating awareness through one-to-one approach  or by addressing the issue in the village meetings you will have many to  support you in your endeavour.
