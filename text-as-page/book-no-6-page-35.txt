Pregnant Woman Full-Term 

Key tasks to be undertaken: 
 Know what are the important tasks in taking care of the newborn. 
 Be able to carry out these tasks if required. 
 Ensure that SBA does not apply fundal pressure or gives injections to   speed up labour.  
 Put baby to breast as soon as possible at er birth (provided mother is   comfortable). 
 If the delivery is taking place at home, in case of complications, mother   and baby should be referred to the nearest health facility.  

5. Care during Delivery 

Observation of the delivery process was   not part of previous ASHA training   modules. In this module, you will be   oriented to normal delivery processes   and newborn care, and also develop the   skills for recording the various events and   pregnancy outcome. Even though you are   not required to manage delivery, you may   have to help if the delivery starts during   transport. This knowledge also gives you   conﬁ dence to know more about this.  
You should try and stay with the pregnant   woman through delivery in the institution   or at home, and post-partum period.   You could therefore also be a ‘Birth   Companion’ to the mother during the stay   at the institution. This is not a compulsion,   but a desirable service. Alternatively,   a close relative could also be the birth   companion.
