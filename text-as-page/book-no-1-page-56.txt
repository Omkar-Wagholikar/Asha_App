Anganwadi-behen needs help 
You can help her in so many ways. 
The babies younger than 3 years cannot  come on their own in the AW. Mothers  sometimes bring them to AW at  mealtime. However, often they are  either left at home or taken along on  work. Many babies suffer under  nutrition after breastfeeding stops.  They remain undernourished. How can  we help in this problem? 
Parents assume that the child gets a full meal in  the Anganwadi, and may give it less in the home. This makes the  supplement less helpful. you need to talk to childâ€™s parents on this. 
Some difficulties about regular food supply affect AW services. You can  raise these issues during meetings with Panchayat members.
