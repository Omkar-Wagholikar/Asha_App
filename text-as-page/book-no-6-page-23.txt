 Determining LMP and EDD 
When pregnancy is diagnosed, you should help the pregnant woman in   calculating the probable date when she is likely to deliver.  
Steps to ﬁ nd the EDD 
• Find out from the woman the date of the ﬁ rst day of her LMP. 
• Then count nine months a� er that date. 
• Add seven days to that date. 
For example,  
If the ﬁ rst day of the LMP is:    10th Dec. 2009  Nine months later is:   10th Sept. 2010  Adding seven days is:   17th Sept. 2010  Therefore, the expected date of delivery is    17th September 2010 

Note: This method only gives an approximate date of delivery, and baby may be   born anytime during 15 days before or after the EDD.  
This picture drawn beside   helps you in estimating the   date of delivery.
