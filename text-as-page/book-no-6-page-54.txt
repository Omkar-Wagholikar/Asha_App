Managing Common Breastfeeding Problems 
Sore nipples 
Causes:  poor latch-on or positioning at breast 

Management  Improve attachment and/or position. 
Continue breastfeeding (reduce engorgement if present). 
Build mothers confidence. 
Advise her to wash breast once a day; not to use soap for this. 
 Put a little breast milk on nipples after feeding is finished (to lubricate the nipple) and air-dry. 
Wear loose clothing. 
 If nipples are very red, shiny, flaky, itchy, and their condition does not get better with above treatment, it   may be fungus infection. Apply gentian violet paint to nipples after each breastfeed for five days. If the   condition does not improve, refer to a doctor. 

Inverted nipples 
Sometimes the nipple will retract in to the breast, and can be checked even during pregnancy.   The best treatment is to encourage the mother to gently pull out the nipple and roll it, several times in a day.  

Not enough milk 
Causes:  Delayed initiation of breastfeeding; infrequent   feeding; giving fluids other than breast milk; mothers   anxiety, exhaustion, insecurity; inadequate family support. 

Management  Decide whether there is enough milk or not: 
Does the baby pass urine six times or more each day? 
Has the baby gained sufficient weight? (During the 1st week there is   usually a small weight loss, after that a newborn should gain 150-  200 gm per week.) 
Is the baby satisfied after feeds? 
Re-assure mother. 
If there is not enough milk, have the baby feed more often. 
Check breastfeed to observe mother attachment and positioning of the   mother and baby. 
Encourage rest. Emphasise the mother to drink and eat more. 
Praise her and return for follow-up.
