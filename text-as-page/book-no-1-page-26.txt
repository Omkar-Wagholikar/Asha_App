Toilet practices 
In India many people go to open fields for defecation. You need to help them  in getting sanitary latrines installed. These are convenient for young girls,  women, aged, sick person and children who often find it difficult to go to  fields. You will get more information about construction of sanitary latrines  from the block Panchayat office. After defecation, most use water-wash for  anal clean up. This soils the hand with germs. It is necessary to wash the hands  thoroughly after this, with soap or ash. Some people use paper or leaves of  some trees for anal clean up. This may be actually healthier as avoids soiling  of hands with germs. 

Hand wash 
Many diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid etc are caused due to germs present  on dirty hands. You should ensure that your hands are clean, especially before  eating any food. Wash your hands with plain water first and then with soap and  see the difference in wash water. You will appreciate the difference. After going  to the toilet and before having meal, we must wash our hands thoroughly. 
Wash the hands with a lot of water first. Apply soap or ashes and rub on the  hands particularly the nails, tip of the fingers and between them. Again, pour  water. Dry it with a clean piece of cloth or napkin. 
Cutting nails regularly removes space for collection of dirt. Long nails may be  fashionable but also hide germs, if not properly cleaned.
