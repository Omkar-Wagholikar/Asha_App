1. Care of the Baby at the time of Delivery 

Many babies die immediately after birth due to   asphyxia. In case of home delivery, when mild labour   pains start, you can manage asphyxiated babies by   removing mucus and can initiate respiration with the   help of the instruments you have. 
You should encourage the mother to   start breastfeeding immediately after   the delivery, as this will help in quick   delivery of placenta and minimises   bleeding. Starting to breastfeed   immediately after the birth makes   the baby stronger. 
Chances of the baby’s death and   getting sick are higher among the   babies born before time (pre-term)   and in LBW babies, (Weight less   than 2500 gm increases the risk   and below 1800 gm, the risk is   considered very high.)
