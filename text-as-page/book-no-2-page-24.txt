Unsafe Abortions &   Medical Termination   of Pregnancy (MTP)  

6 

You know that sometimes unwanted pregnancies occur. In such cases, the   family or woman may want to abort the pregnancy. For this termination,   pregnant women often go to untrained persons, dais etc. The methods   employed by them for termination are not safe and the facilities are   unhygienic. Hence, there is a great risk to the life of these women. You   can educate such women with unwanted pregnancies about the dangers   of these illegal, unsafe abortions. Such women should be able to confirm   whether they are pregnant and if so, they can seek safe and legal abortion   at a government health centre or government approved private hospital.  
Abortions have been legalized since 1971 under certain conditions, as   given in under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (“MTP” Act).   Such abortions can be carried out up to the fifth month (20 weeks) of   pregnancy.  
Government primary health centres can carry out abortion till eight weeks   (2 months), while for an abortion after this period, a woman would have to   go a hospital. Abortions done early in pregnancy are also safer than those   carried out later. Hence, the woman should not wait till her pregnancy   has advanced.
