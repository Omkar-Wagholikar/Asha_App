Measuring fever in adults 
It is wise to take a sick person’s temperature even if   she/he does not mention about having fever. Touch   your own forehead and the person’s forehead with   both sides of your hand. If the person’s forehead   is warmer than yours, she/he may have fever. This   is a simple way to find out if someone has fever   or not.  

Thermometer is used for measuring temperature 

  Take a simple oral thermometer and shake it well.   See that its mercury mark is below normal (36°C   or 98.4°F). Do not hold or touch the bulb of the   thermometer. Hold the thermometer by the bigger   end with no mercury because mercury line will go up   and you might get a wrong reading. 

Put the thermometer’s bulb end under the tongue in   the patient’s mouth or armpit for two minutes. 

The oral temperature is a bit higher than the armpit.  

Take it out to see closely while turning it slowly. 

Record the temperature of a sick person. Is it more than   36°C/98.4°F? 

Temperature of 37°C–39°C is mild fever. 

Between 39°C and 40°C is moderate fever.  

Above 40°C it is high fever (refer any person with high fever after   sponging and tablet Paracetamol).  

Clean it with water after each use. 

For your information, thermometers have mercury inside which is toxic   and hence adequate care should be taken when used for children. 

Treating Fever 

General treatment 

Mild fever generally needs no treatment unless we are thinking of   some infections like malaria, TB, pneumonia etc. 

For moderate fever Paracetamol tablet is the best treatment. One   tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. For more details see table
