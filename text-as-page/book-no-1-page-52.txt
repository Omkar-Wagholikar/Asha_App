Nurse Didi:  Where does our nursedidi work from? It is a health sub center. The  sub center actually works for 5-6 villages (3000-5000 population). We have a  nursedidi called ANM and a health worker brother called Male Multipurpose  Worker (MPW). Together they do various tasks for the villages. We will need to  work with them more closely. 

The Health Sub Center 
Let us look at our sub center more closely. The  health sub center may be your nearest health  facility. Our sub center has a nursedidi and  a MPW. Their main tasks are: 

Immunization of children to  prevent six dangerous illnesses.  Routine checkup of pregnant  women,   conducting   normal  deliveries and post natal care. 

Helping couples to adopt spacing  and sterilization services. 

Treatment for TB, Leprosy and Malaria 

Treatment of minor ailments. 

Visiting Anganwadis and schools for health check up. 

Child care including treatment for diarrhea and coughs 

Advice on village sanitation, water safety etc. 
The ANM and MPW have difficult tasks. The villages under their care spread  out on 8-10 km area. They have to often walk distances, and be on move. They  visit houses to conduct provide some services. For some services like  Immunization, they conduct clinics on a fixed day each month in a central  place such as anganwadi centres in the village. They have also to make reports  of monthly health activities and attend meetings at PHCs. 

We can do this 
Develop good links with nursedidi and MPW. Know about the facilities available  with them. Help them in their tasks. 

What do you think about this? 

People say the nursedidi hardly stays at one place. 

People call the MPW as the malaria worker.
