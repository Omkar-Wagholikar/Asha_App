Choices in matter of Contraception: 
Government policy does not promote any specific method for contraception.  Each women and couple has to decide about particular contraceptive method  based on their reproductive intentions and preferences, after analyzing  information about contraceptives and matching their own preferences. You can  counsel the couples about contraceptive methods. 
As ASHA, you should counsel couples about available contraceptive  methods. You can also get more information about contraceptives from  nursedidi and doctor. 

Think about this: 

Abortion is good family planning method. 

Decision about family planning method should be left with the  nursedidi/doctor. 

Government should give incentives for those accepting sterilisation.
