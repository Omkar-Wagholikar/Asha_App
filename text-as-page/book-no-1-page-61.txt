Germs, worms, insects-illnesses and immunity 

Most of the common illnesses are due to germs, small insects and worms. We  can often see worms in the excreta. The small insects like louse are visible. The  scabies insect is even smaller. Germs are too small to see with eyes. For this we  need a microscope. Have you seen a microscope. 
Examples of germ illnesses are: Malaria, chickenpox TB, measles, leprosy, many  types of diarrheas and dysentery. The gravity and period of illness vary with the  germ-type and our resistance to that germ. 
Immunity is the resistance of our body to fight germs. Immunity develops as  body gets experience of 
fighting germs. Immunity helps us recover from a germ-illness. Immunity may  be natural like in leprosy. Remember only some people get leprosy illness, many  escape it. 
Mothers breast milk gives some immunity for the baby. The first few days thick  milk is a priceless shield for the baby. Sadly, many infants do not get it because  wrong beliefs and practices.
