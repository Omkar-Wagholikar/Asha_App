Relapse of TB in patients who have had previous treatment is possible.   Many times, such patients are considered as new patients. The record of   previous treatment should be made known to the health facility where the   patient presents for re-treatment so that a diﬀ erent drug regimen may be   prescribed. 

Precautions for Anti-TB Treatment among Pregnant Women 
Women in child bearing age should be counselled to avoid pregnancy   while on anti-TB treatment and at least six months a� er. 
The eﬀ ect of oral contraceptives is reduced by medicines and hence, other   methods of contraception should be advocated. 
One of the TB drugs, Streptomycin,  should not be  given in the ﬁ rst   trimester of pregnancy.
