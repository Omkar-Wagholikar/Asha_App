How will I improve myself? 
What difficulties do I foresee while implementing my plan? 
How will I overcome these difficulties? 
Whose support will I require? 
How will I monitor my self-development plan? 
Suggestions for monitoring my self-development plan: 
Review your daily performance as you close the day. Note the efforts you  made for self-development as per your plan. If you have not been able to  do it, think about the reasons. Reflect on what you will do differently so  that you do not come up with these reasons again. 
Try to maintain a diary and write down the important steps that you have  taken to develop yourself, what difficulties you faced and how you  overcame them. 
You may share your self-development plan with a person whom you trust.  You may take regular feedback from that person to learn whether she/he  has noticed the changes in you. 
Note:  Once you achieve what you had planned, develop a new plan and  follow the same steps .
