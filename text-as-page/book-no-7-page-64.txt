iv.   All fever cases that approach you and are unable to go to the primary   health centre within a day, should be screened using RDT and blood   slides. Fever cases which turn out to be RDT positive should be provided   treatment immediately. You should store the positive RDT along with the   blood slide for Quality Assurance (QA) check at a later date. For cases   which are RDT negative, you should send blood slides to the laboratory.   For those with a positive result, you can treat the cases following the   drug regimen in which you are trained.  
v.   All fever cases should be given paracetamol and fever managed as per   the guidelines. The persons who test positive for malaria would be   given with either chloroquine drug or ACT drugs (depending on the   instructions in that area) followed by primaquine for radical treatment.  
vi. Whenever you do a blood test or give a drug you should make a record   of it in your diary. You should, provide the information during the   monthly ASHA review meeting to the ANM or to your supervisor.   If payment is being made for this work, you may be also required to   maintain a register. 
vii. Transport of slides and obtaining the result of the test: The   slides collected by you should be delivered to the sub-  centre by you or by anyone whom you request, on a day to   day basis. These slides should then be transported to the   PHC lab preferably twice a week, or less by the MPW (M)   and if not, the MPW (F). The results should be conveyed to   you by the MPW (M) and if not the MPW (F).  
viii. If there is a pregnant woman in a high malaria area, you   should facilitate her ge� ing a insecticide treated bed net   at the time of the ﬁ rst antenatal care check up and follow   up to see that she uses it. A� er delivery you should ensure   that the baby from the time of birth also sleeps under an   insecticide treated bed-net.  

Diary 

ix.   If a pregnant woman gets high fever and chills, ensure that she is taken to   see a doctor. You could start Chloroquine or ACT  immediately if there is a   delay in seeing a doctor.. Do NOT give primaquine to a pregnant woman   or a child below one year of age.
