Engorged and painful breasts (very full breasts) 
Causes:  Delayed initiation of breastfeeding, poor attachment, incomplete   emptying of breasts, restricting the length of the feeds. 

Management 
 Prevent by: 

Starting breastfeeding soon after delivery and                  feeding often..  
Ensuring correct attachment.  
Encouraging on-demand feeding. 

 If baby is able to suckle, feed more frequently, help with positioning. 
If the baby is not able to attach, apply warm compresses to breast,   gently massage from outside toward the nipple and express some milk   until the areola is soft, then put baby to the breast, making sure that the   attachment is correct. 
Have baby feed often to empty out the breasts. If it is not possible, ask   the mother to express some milk herself. 
If breasts are red and hard, continue to feed often. Use warm   compresses and gently massage breasts towards nipple. Take   mother’s temperature. If she has fever, mother should visit the doctor.   She should continue to breastfeed (from both sides) even if she is   taking antibiotics.  

Expressing milk by hand 
1. Wash hands with soap and water. 
2. Place a warm compress on the breast for a few minutes if desired. 
3. Gently massage the breast starting from the chest moving toward the   nipple; do this in a circle (near the underarm, and then to the bo� om of   the breast etc.), so that all parts of the breast are massaged. 
4. Lean forward and support the bo� om of the breast with one hand. 
5. Hold the areola between thumb and two ﬁ ngers of other hand. Put her   hand on the areola above the nipple and the two ﬁ ngers on the areola   below the nipple. 
6. Press toward the chest (about 1-2 cm) and then squeeze the milk   reservoirs beneath the areola (do not squeeze the nipple). 
7. Press and release the thumb and ﬁ rst ﬁ nger several times until the milk   drips out. Use a clean bo� le or a cup to collect the milk. Milk may drip at   the beginning and then spray out a� er it starts ﬂ owing. 
8. Rotate the thumbs and ﬁ nger around the areola so that the milk is   removed from all the reservoirs. 
9. Repeat with the other breast.
