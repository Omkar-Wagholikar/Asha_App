READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA 

The second visit should be made between the fourth and sixth   month  

The third visit should be planned in the eighth month  

An additional visit in the ninth month would help provide better   care.  

If the health worker identifies health problems during these visits, a   visit to a doctor will become necessary. 

What is done during pregnancy check-up and care? 

During the first check-up the complete   history of this pregnancy and previous   pregnancies, if any, and whether the woman   has had any medical/surgical problem in the   past is taken.  

  
The ANM will weigh the woman to see   whether the woman is gaining adequate   weight during pregnancy, and also check   blood pressure (using a balloon-like   instrument), and see whether it is normal   or not. 

  
Breast examination to check whether   breasts and the nipples are normal  will   be carried. 

 
 Abdominal examination will be done to know the growth/position of   the baby. 

 
 A simple blood test will be done to see if the woman is anaemic (lacks   blood) and if so, the severity. If the woman has anaemia, prompt   treatment will help prevent complications. 

 
Urine examination 

 
TT Injection 

 
 During repeated visits, details of any problem appearing since last   visit will be taken care of. BP, weight, and abdominal examination   will be repeated. 

 
 Iron tablets will be given to all pregnant women and   also treatment for anaemia depending upon the blood   test results. 

 
 By carrying out a complete pregnancy check-up, the   ANM would be able to detect problems and decide on   referring the woman to a doctor.
