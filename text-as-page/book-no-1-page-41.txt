You may have seen the guts of sheep or  chicken. Human gut is about 22 ft long-  more than a room length. Gut is part of  the digestive system and digests/absorbs  food. While passing through, food will  be mixed with secretions from different  glands. It also throws off the waste.  Whatever body cannot put to use in sent  in large intestine and later leaves body  through anal opening. Digestion gives us  energy to work and nutrients to build and  repair the body. 
Respiratory system provides us with oxygen by breathing air. Lungs inside  our chest cavity helps us in inhalation and exhalation. Impure air is let  out. Oxygen is necessary for burning food to produce energy. 
We have about 5-6 liters of blood in our body. This goes in rounds thanks to  our heart pumping each second. Do you know how much blood the heart pumps  in a day? That will fill a water tanker of 10000 liters in 24 hrs. The heart keeps  your blood pumping at all times as it picks up oxygen from your lungs and  nutrients from digestive system and send them to different cells of body.  Younger you are faster is your heart beat. The blood carries nutrients and  oxygen. It also picks up wastes from the organs. Blood works like trucks and  wagons in the body, through the vessels. 
Urinary system throws away urine and cleanses the body. Skin also throws out sweat. 
Reproductive system is different in men and women. It helps in reproduction  and continuation of life on earth. 
We know the world through our five windows. We call them sense organs. The  eyes see, ears hear, nose smells, tongue tastes and skin gets touch, pressure,  vibration and pain. 
Thanks to the Nervous system, we respond to these signals. Human brain is  most complex object in the world. We make necessary movement or change  alertness. This is necessary for our survival. The Nervous system controls several  body functions. Nerves act as electric wires to control all systems.
