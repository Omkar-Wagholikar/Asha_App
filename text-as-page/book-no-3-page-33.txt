Changes in bleeding 
Sometimes, the ovary does not release an egg. When this happens, the   body makes less hormone, which can cause changes in how often and how   much a woman bleeds. Girls whose monthly bleeding has just begun  or   women who have recently stopped breastfeeding  may bleed only every   few months, or have very little or too much bleeding. Their cycles usually   become more regular with time. Women using hormonal family planning,   sometimes have bleeding in the middle of the month. 
Older women who have not yet gone through menopause may have heavier   bleeding or bleed more often than when they were younger. As they get   closer to menopause, they may stop having monthly bleeding for a few   months and then have it again. 

Pain with monthly bleeding 
During monthly bleeding the womb squeezes in order to push out the   lining. The squeezing can cause pain in the lower belly or lower back,   sometimes called cramps. The pain may begin before bleeding starts or   just after it starts. 

Tips for taking care 

Do exercise, walk and run  

Rub your lower belly. This helps the tight muscles to relax. 

Fill a plastic bottle or some other container with hot water and place   it on your lower belly or lower back. Or, use a thick cloth you have   soaked in hot water. 

Drink tea with ginger. Women in your community may know of other   remedies that work for this kind of pain. 

Take a mild medicine for pain with doctors advice. 

Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) 

Some women and girls feel uncomfortable one or two weeks   before their monthly bleeding begins. They may have one or   more of a group of signs that are known as pre-menstrual   syndrome (PMS). Women who have PMS may notice: 


Sore breasts 


A full feeling in the lower belly 


Constipation (when you cannot pass stool) 


Feeling extra tired
