How to Handle Difficult Situations 

If you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then  continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue and  review the options. It is also may be a good idea to adjourn and let people  think about it overnight. 

Description of an Effective Decision 

An effective decision should not leave any unhappy feeling  among group members after the meeting has been  adjourned. 

An effective decision can be translated into reality. It should  not be decision impossible to put in action. 

An effective decision can be lived with. It does not set up      conflict of a debilitating nature among persons or groups. 

An effective decision must involve the group enough for the      members to implement the decision.
