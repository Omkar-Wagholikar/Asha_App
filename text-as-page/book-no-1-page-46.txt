Many men women treat women badly, and  even beat them. Women are also sexually  assaulted. Such women suffer from  injuries and other health problems. 
Women’s health problems are often  ignored or treated late. They have to  get permission of the in-laws or  husband’s even for health check up. They  often have no money to pay for health  care on their own. Our health services are  also not fully sensitive to women’s health  care needs. 
Infertility can result from health problems of either husband or wife. But  usually it is the woman who gets the blame and mis-treated. 
If a woman gets daughters, she gets the blame again. In reality it all depends  on the man’s sperm. We will learn later to see how the sex of the baby is  determined. Many families go for abortion if it is a girl baby in the womb as  they want sons. You can check from your anganwadi behen as how many boys  and girls are registered at Aanganwadi centre. 
Women bear all the trouble of childbirth, abortions. They also bear burden of  preventing pregnancies. Most contraceptive methods are for women and very  few for men. 
Women’s reproductive systems are more vulnerable for sexually  transmitted infections. Vagina provides a larger surface,  delicate skin, longer time to hold fluids, moistness to  make germs stay alive for longer. So they get more  infections than men. 
Even illnesses affect women differently. Malaria fever  can cause abortions, affect growth of baby in the womb. 
On top of all, women are married young. They suffer its  damage in several ways-socially, economically, and  to health.
