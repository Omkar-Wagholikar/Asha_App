Each lesson is about 2-3 pages, and can be completed in half an hour. In  each lesson, you have some knowledge bits, and some skills to learn. At the  end there are some points to think about. Your facilitators will help and  encourage you to find out the solutions of these issues. For skills, you will  have the opportunity of hands-on experience or demonstrations to  be organized by the facilitators. During the sessions, you can practice  some skills. 
So after the first learning exposure of seven days, you will have acquired  preliminary knowledge on most themes. You are supposed to take simple  assessment after each exposure. These assessments will help in making  appropriate changes if required. 
After completion of first exposure, you will be working in the village and  along with Nursedidi, the Anganwadi behen, Self Help Group (SHG)  members and the male MPW worker. You will have some assignments to do  in the village, like water disinfection, or attending the ANC clinic/health  day. Your facilitators will give these assignments after each exposure.  You will keep record of assignments given to you and share in the  next exposure. 
The book number 1 is simple enough to understand for even 4th-5th standard  educated women. As we move on to the other books, lessons will be focused  on slightly complex issues. The learning programme is participatory. You learn,  and your facilitators help you to learn. You should ask questions and seek  solutions to likely problems you may anticipate during your work in the village.  in your work. 
Our best wishes are with you, to serve the village health care needs!
