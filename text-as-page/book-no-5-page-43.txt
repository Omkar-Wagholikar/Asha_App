Sub: request to organise MAMTA Day at two locations in the village 
Dear CDHO (write the name of the concerned person): 
I am working as ASHA for the village ________ of ________ Block. My village  has a population of ________ . The houses are scattered across the areas.  The ANM regularly comes and organises MAMTA Day. However, it is  organised at a place which is not accessible for all the pregnant women.  A large number of women living on the other side of the village, are not  able to attend the antenatal clinic, due to the distance. 
I suggest that the antenatal clinic may be conducted in two places of the  village on different dates. I had a discussion about the same with the  ANM. She informed me that she needs permission from you. I request you  to look into this matter. As an ASHA I take the responsibility to bring all  the pregnant women so they have their antenatal check-up. You are  welcome to visit our village. 
Thank you.  Yours sincerely,  ASHA ( write name of ASHA and the village)
