Making ORS 

If the ORS packet is not available, teach the mother how to make home-made   ORS: For one glass (200 ml) of water, add a pinch of salt and a spoon of sugar.   (See in the diagram how a pinch of salt is taken with three ﬁ ngers and how   a spoon of sugar is measured). Alternatively, one litre of water with 50 gm of   sugar (8 spoons) and 5 gm (a teaspoon ) of salt. A juice of half a lime can be   squeezed in. Taste to see that it is not too salty, or too sugary. It should taste of   tears. Spoon is taken as 5 ml. Measure this amount and ensure it comes to 5 ml.  
Nowadays, one litre plastic water bo� les are available and can be used to measure the   correct quantity of water.
