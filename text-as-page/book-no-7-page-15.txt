Anaemia in the Young Child 
Anaemia is important to diagnose because it commonly comes along with   malnutrition. It may be a cause of poor appetite. Blood testing is essential,   but even in its absence based on observation of pallor alone, treatment can be   started.  

Looking for Anaemia in Children 
Unusual paleness (Pallor) of the skin of the soles or palms is a sign of   anaemia.   
To see if the child has anaemia, look at the skin of the childs palm. Hold   the childs palm open by grasping it gently from side to side. 
Do not stretch the  ngers backward. This may cause pallor.  
Compare the childs palm with your own palm and the palm of other   children. If the skin is paler than of others, the child has pallor.  
Treatment for anaemia is to give one tablet of paediatric iron daily. And also   give one tablet of Albendazole for deworming once in six months. For a child   less than two years, give half a tablet of Albendazole (Refer Annexure 6). Iron   rich foods as discussed for the mother (Book 6) are also needed for the young   child. If anaemia does not improve, the child must be referred to a doctor for   more complete blood tests and treatment.
