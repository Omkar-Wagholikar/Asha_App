Part B 

The placenta usually comes out at er 15-20 minutes.  

Points for you to pay attention to if you are also present at the time of delivery in   the institution: 

It is not necessary to shave the area, or give an enema to the mother at the   time of delivery. 

All deliveries do not require an episiotomy (cut at the perineal site). 

Fundal pressure (pushing on the abdomen) should not be applied. 

You should be alert if injections are being given to hasten the delivery   process. Such injections can cause a baby who is still born, birth of a  
baby who is unable to breathe, or even cause the death of the newborn.   However, the same injections are advisable after the baby has been born   in order to control bleeding after delivery. Only the ANM or doctor should   give the injection.  

When the mother and baby stay in the hospital and if you are staying with   them as a birth companion, she should ensure that the mother and baby   are seen by the MO and nurse at least twice a day and whenever required   if there are problems.  

The very top of the head comes  rst, then the eyes, nose and mouth (d). While   in most babies, the eyes are facing the  oor; sometimes they are born looking   towards the ceiling. When the babys head is out, it turns to one side (e) and the   shoulders and rest of the body are delivered (f). Once out, the baby will cry.  

Delivery of Placenta  
The cord will be connected to the placenta which is still inside the womb.
