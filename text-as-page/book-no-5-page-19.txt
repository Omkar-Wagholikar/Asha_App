Understanding the  Human Rights and  the Fundamental  Rights 

Every individual needs to have knowledge about their Human and their  Fundamental Rights. Usually we do not come across information on this topic.  Also, in the past you may not have discussed this topic with others. As an  ASHA you need to know about rights. It will help you to learn about your and  your community’s rights. It will also help you to take appropriate decisions for  the development of your community. You may be reading about Fundamental  and Human Rights for the  first time and you may find the information  boring. We urge you to read this chapter. We have tried to make the  information  simple, interesting and relevant. 
Think of some time in the past when you felt hurt because someone did not  respect you. These include things people may have said about you to make  you feel stupid or silly. For example, some one may have told you, “There is  no use talking to you, you will not understand.” Try and remember one or two  such hurtful statements/incidents.   
In 1948, after the global suffering in World War II, all the countries in the  world agreed that it would be a more peaceful world if every human being  respected the dignity of every other human being. As a result, the Universal  Human Right Declaration came in existence. Our country has also agreed to  this Declaration.
