(d) Remind mother when the immunisation is due and   alert her to the date when the VHND is being held. 
(e) If needed, escort the mother and baby to the   VHND on the date when the vaccine is due.   This is important for families who do not access   services such as those from poor and marginalised   communities. 
(f) Ensure that ﬁ rst dose of BCG and oral polio is given   soon a� er the baby is born. 
(g) Mobilising children for VHND: 
(i) Find out from the ANM when her next visit is due. If ASHA has her   mobile number, conﬁ rm it on previous or same day.  
(ii) You must ensure that poorest and most distant households receives   special a� ention to access the service. 
(iii) Some children are more likely to be le�  out than others. This includes   physically or mentally challenged children, children of migrant   families, children belonging to families considered of ‘lower status’   or diﬀ erent from the majority of the village. Such children and such   families are said to be ‘marginalised’. They need your special a� ention   and assistance. 
(iv) Some hamlets or urban slums/basti have neither ANM or Anganwadi   centre/worker taking care of their health needs. As an immediate step   to address the issue. This needs to be corrected. As an immediate step,   a women representative of the hamlet/slum can be included into the   ‘village health and sanitation commi� ee’.  
(v) The village health plan should help identify hamlets and communities   that are under-serviced. We will learn about village health plans in a   later module.
