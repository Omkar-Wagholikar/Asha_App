Two kidneys are filters of blood making urine. They sit on the very back wall of  abdomen. Urine from kidneys reaches urinary bladder through tubes. 
One feels tense in the lower abdomen when urine is held up for a long time.  That is where the urinary bladder is. From bladder the urine is let out through  a single tube opening on genitals. 

Reproductive organs are different in men and women. 
Testes are hanging in a pouch to keep them cool. From the testes two thick  cords carry sperms to two small bags close to urethra. They make semen  carrying sperms. The semen is thrown out through urethra at the end of  sexual intercourse. 
In women vagina is a passage from private parts to opening of uterus. Uterus  –the womb-is a small purse with thick walls, hanging upside-down in the  lower abdomen. It is protected by the pelvic bones. The womb grows in  pregnancy with the growing baby inside. In pregnancy we can feel the womb  on the abdomen. 
Two egg-tubes are attached to uterus on both sides. The tubes have free finger  like ends. The fingers catch the eggs released from ovaries. The two ovaries  flank the uterus. 
Outer parts of genitals are also different in men and women. 
In men testes are hanging in a pouch on each side. The urethra opens on the  end of a long muscular penis. 
In women urethra and vagina open on the vulva. Inner vulva is soft tags of  flesh. These are aptly called inner lips of vulva. The inner lips are connected  above at clitoris. Clitoris is small external bud like organ. A fleshy cushion of  vulva–called outer lips–protect all these parts. 
The vulva completely folds over vagina in very young girls. Hymen, a thin sheet  with holes covers the vaginal opening. This may be torn after puberty. After  puberty the vulva also opens up baring clitoris. Breasts also grow in women at  the age of maturity. 
At maturity both men and women have hair on the genitals.
