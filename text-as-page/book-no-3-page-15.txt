READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA 

Next monthly bleeding will take place within 14 days of scheduled day   of monthly bleeding. These pills are now available at health centres and   also at pharmacy shops. No prescription is needed to buy them. They are   available as EC pills in the programme. Several commercial and social   marketing brands are also available.  
ECPs, taken as per instructions, provide protection against unwanted   pregnancy. Discourage repeated use of ECP and advise for choosing a   contraceptive method. ECPs do not protect against infections like STI and   HIV/AIDS.  

Copper-T  
This is a small T-shaped intra-uterine device (IUD). It is made of pliable   plastic with fine copper wire wound around its stem. Two plastic threads   hang by its stem. After insertion into the womb, Copper-T stays in place   and is effective for a maximum of ten years. Some Copper-T devices   available in the market are effective for shorter duration also. 

How does the Copper-T work?  
Copper-T works mainly by preventing sperms and egg from   meeting. IUD makes it hard for sperm to move through   the womans reproductive tract and reduces ability of   the sperm to fertilize the egg. Possibly it also prevents   implantation.
