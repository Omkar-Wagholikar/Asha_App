Helping Adolescent   Girls to Take Care of   Themselves during   Menstruation

Staying clean 
Generally girls living in small towns and cities use sanitary pads for   protection during menstrual period, if they can afford them. These are   readymade soft cotton pads worn inside the underwear to catch the blood   as it leaves the vagina. These pads should not be reused. Some girls prefer   to make their own pads out of folded cloth or wads of cotton. These pads   must always be clean and dry when worn. They should be changed several   times a day and disposed of by burning outdoors in a large empty tin. If   cloth is used, they should be washed well with soap and water and dried in   the sun. Sun light is the cheapest disinfectant   available in nature.  
In villages there are certain restrictions imposed   on adolescents during menstruation. Those   restrictions (Donâ€™ts), which are harmful should   be discouraged, such as not taking bath during   menstruation or not doing any physical work. 
It is advisable to wash outer genitals well with   water every day to remove any blood that is left.
