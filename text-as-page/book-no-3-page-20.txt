Permanent methods  

Vasectomy (male sterilization)  
This is a very small operation for permanently preventing childbirth.   Vasectomy requires less time and not much trouble for men. No hospital   stay is necessary.  
There are two methods for vasectomy 

Conventional vasectomy 

No scalpel vasectomy 

Conventional vasectomy 
The procedure takes a few minutes and the person can go home in an   hour. An experienced doctor uses a scalpel to make a small slit in the   scrotum, and finds the vas on each side. The vas is tied and cut to stop   the sperms from reaching the semen sac. One stitch is required. 

No scalpel vasectomy 
The  no-scalpel  method uses only a needle puncture to complete the   process. No stitch is required. So no need to come back for stitch removal.   This method is becoming popular. Now doctors are being trained in   this new technique. There are less side effects of NSV as compared to   conventional vasectomy. This is a safe and easy method and requires only   10-15 minutes. 
Men commonly think that vasectomy causes weakness â€” in work and   sexual life. This is not true and there is no evidence about it so far. The   testicles are not even touched in vasectomy. It is the testicles that secrete   hormones and regulate sexual functions. Vasectomy does not affect this   any way. There is a need to popularize vasectomy. 

Why sometimes pregnancy occurs after vasectomy? 
After vasectomy three months are needed to make the semen sperm-free.   A condom has to be used during this period This point is often ignored by   men and conception can take place. Condom use for three months after   vasectomy can prevent chances of pregnancy.
