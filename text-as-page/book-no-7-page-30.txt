Plan B: If the child has diarrhoea and some dehydration 

Remember:  
Classify all cases of diarrhoea for dehydration. In   addition also classify as severe persistent diarrhoea if   duration is 14 days or more and dysentery if there is   blood in stool. 
Children with signs of severe dehydration should be referred to   hospital.  Children with severe persistent diarrhoea should be referred to   hospital.  Children with dysentery could be treated with medicine at home. If   they have high fever or look unwell, they should be referred.  Children with some dehydration should be rehydrated with ORS.  Children who are not dehydrated and have diarrhoea of less than   14 days duration should be managed at home. 
Where is ORS Available: Part of drug kit, available in the Sub-Centre; PHC.  Treatment with zinc will be taught to ASHAs if the state is prepared and   has introduced it into the programme. 
Determine the amount of ORS over a four hour period

If the child wants more ORS than shown, encourage the mother to give it. 
For infants under six months who are not breastfed, also give 100-200 ml   clean water during this period.
