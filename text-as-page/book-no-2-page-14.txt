Home care during pregnancy 

The woman’s family and community have the key responsibility for   making sure that the woman gets more food, takes rest and does not   have to do heavy manual work during pregnancy 

The pregnant woman needs extra energy from food, for the sake of   her own health, for the growing foetus and for effective breastfeeding   later on. 

During pregnancy a nutritious diet which is rich in iron, calcium and   protein is required. For this, a pregnant woman should eat more green,   leafy vegetables like palak and sarson, dals, milk, jaggery, eggs, fish,   meat, etc.  Taboos and restrictions on a pregnant woman’s diet, such   as not allowing certain vegetables, fruits, milk and ghee, might in fact   harm her and the baby.  

Pregnant women are entitled to get food from the anganwadi   centre.  

A pregnant woman should not fast. This deprives her and the growing   baby inside the uterus of essential food.  

Pregnant women should not carry out heavy manual labour, like   working on construction sites, famine relief, brick kilns, etc. Other   members of the family and community should help to reduce her work   burden.
