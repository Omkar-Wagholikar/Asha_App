Keeping newborn warm and the problem of hypothermia  

Why is it important to keep baby warm after delivery?  Babies have diﬃ  culty maintaining their temperature at   birth and in the ﬁ rst day of life.They come out wet, and   lose heat quickly. If they get cold, they use up energy,   and can become sick. LBW and pre-term babies are at   greater risk of ge� ing cold. 
When and why do most newborns get cold?  Most newborns lose heat in ﬁ rst minute a� er delivery.   They are born wet. If they are le�  wet and naked, they lose a lot of heat to the   air. A newborn baby’s skin is very thin and its head is big in size compared   to its body. It loses heat very quickly from its head. Babies do not have the   capacity to keep themselves warm. If the newborn baby is not properly dried,   wrapped, and its head is not kept covered, it can lose 2 to 4 degree Celsius   within 10-20 minutes. 
Example:  If the baby’s temperature was 97.7 degree Fahrenheit (36.5 degree   Celsius) (normal temperature) at the time of birth and if there was a loss of   2.7 degree Fahrenheit because the baby was not properly dried and covered,   the body temperature will become 95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius),   which is below normal.  
What is the term for a situation when a baby’s temperature falls below   normal?  When a baby has a temperature below normal, it suﬀ ers from  hypothermia. 
What happens to a baby with hypothermia?  A baby who is cold, and has a low temperature (hypothermia) suﬀ ers from: 
Decreased ability to suckle at the breast, leading to poor feeding and   weakness.
