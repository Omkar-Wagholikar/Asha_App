Knowing  Myself 

Understanding oneself is crucial to know about one’s own personality and  temperament, our strengths, limitations and areas for development. The  process of knowing oneself is continuous and we need to review our strengths  and limitations from time to time, which will help us to change. We need to  constantly grow in our capacities in order to ensure that we are able to  facilitate the process of development and empowerment at the community  level too. However before we attempt to empower the community we need  to know whether we are empowered ourselves. 
Remember we were created by nature with a unique body, soul and mind. All  human beings have different characteristics and personalities. The external  environment influences our personality. As  women, directly or indirectly, we  are told that ours is a subordinate role. We usually do not question this kind of  attitude towards us. In fact, we are not trained to question the daily  inequality that we face. We accept the social norms without any questioning.  A woman who questions them, is viewed as “out of control.” 
Let us understand how this attitude affects our personality. In our Indian  society a woman is identified by her relationship with others, like that of a  daughter, mother, wife, etc. Being brought up in a patriarchal society, a  woman internalises these norms, which makes her devalue herself. She does  not think of herself as worthwhile and neglects all her needs. All this affects  her self-esteem and overall personality.
