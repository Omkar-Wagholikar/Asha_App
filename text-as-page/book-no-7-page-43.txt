Who should not use an IUCD?  You should not counsel IUCD use if the woman: 
Has never been pregnant. 
Has anaemia (Low Hb). 
Is in danger of ge� ing a Sexually Transmi� ed Infection. (This includes any   woman who has more than one partner, or whose partner may have other   sex partners.) 
Has ever had an infection in her tubes or uterus, or an infection a� er   giving birth or having an abortion.  
Has had a pregnancy in her tubes. 
Has a lot of bleeding and pain during monthly bleeding. 
Common side-eﬀ ects:  The woman may have some light bleeding during the   ﬁ rst week a� er ge� ing an IUCD. Some women also have longer, heavier and   more painful monthly bleeding, but this usually stops a� er the ﬁ rst three   months. 
Who should insert an IUCD:  An IUCD must be inserted by a trained   Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM), nurse or a doctor a� er doing a pelvic   (internal) examination. The best time to have the IUCD inserted is during the   monthly bleeding/period. A� er childbirth, it is best to wait six weeks for the   uterus to return to its normal size and shape before ge� ing an IUCD. 
What to watch for:  Occasionally an IUCD will slip out of place. If this   happens, it will not be eﬀ ective in preventing pregnancy, so it is important for   the woman to learn to check her IUCD to make sure it is still in place. Most   IUCDs have 2 thread-like strings a� ached which hang down into the vagina.   The mother should be counselled to check the strings a� er each monthly   bleeding to make sure the IUCD is in place. 

Teaching a woman to check the IUD strings 
Wash hands. 

Squat down and reach as far as she can into the vagina with two fingers.   Feel for the IUD strings, but do not pull them. 

Take fingers out and wash her hands again. 

Sterilisation (the operation when the couple wants no   more children) 

Since these operations are permanent, they are only good   for those women or men who are certain that they do not   want any more children.
