The role of ASHA in promoting healthy diet and   physical activity 

 Educate community members on the importance of consuming a   healthy diet and help them make healthy food choices based on local   food availability. 

 Undertake group activities to raise awareness about various food groups   that are locally available.  

 Explain the benefits of physical activity and its role in preventing Non-  Communicable Diseases.  

 Work with the VHSNC/MAS and Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI)/ULB   representatives to create spaces such as parks and walking areas that are   safe and clean. 

 Plan group physical activity programmes.  

 In your group or community meetings identify those with NCDs,   undertake follow up through home visits to counsel them on diet   modifications and undertaking regular physical activities.
