Ensure that all the tissue from the front to the back of the   breasts is examined. For the skin and tissue just beneath,   use light pressure; use medium pressure for tissue in the   middle of your breasts; use firm pressure for the deep   tissue in the back.  

When the deep tissue is reached, the individual should   be able to feel down to the ribcage. 
Step 5:  Finally, the breasts should be examined while standing   or sitting. Many women find that the easiest way to feel their   breasts is when their skin is wet and slippery, so this can be   done while taking a bath, using the same hand movements   described in Step 4.
