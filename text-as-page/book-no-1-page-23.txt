How to remain healthy? 
Some parental gifts make part of ones health. Like body features, frame, height,  weight, looks, skin and color, some mental traits etc. Sometimes we even get  some health problems linked to parental gifts. We  can avoid marriage among blood relatives to  avoid some of these inborn defects. 
Many social and economic factors  also cause ill health. Poverty is the  root cause of many sicknesses. Low  purchasing power limits access to  adequate   amount   of   food   and  balanced diet. Women suffer from  sicknesses during the process of giving  birth to a baby. 
Also health care utilization is impacted adversely on account of poverty.  Ignorance also contributes to sickness. Certain traditional practice are  harmful. You should try to know about these traditional practices in  your village.
