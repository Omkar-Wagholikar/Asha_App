Daiâ€™s work and practices 

Dai helps families during childbirth. She is trained by PHC  and ANM to observe Six cleans. 

A clean place to conduct delivery 

Clean hands with water and soap before delivery. 

A clean perineum to avoid infection of mother  and baby. 

Clean thread to tie the umbilical cord and 

A clean new blade to cut the cord and keep the  end clean. 

A clean cloth to wrap the baby 
With this she can ensure the health of the newborn baby and mother. She can  save babies with proper baby care. She is also expected to send mothers with  difficulties to health centers in time. 

Limitations of a Dai 
Dais have limited understanding of a difficult birth and risks. Often they refer  a mother too late. They need good training and help to understand impending  dangers and refer-escort in good time. Some village dais act as a cord cutter
