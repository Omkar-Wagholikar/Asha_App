Leaders represent the community 

A leader is the face of the community. As an ASHA, when you discuss the  health concerns of your community with the health service provider, you are  representing your community. Share their points of view rather than merely  yours. 
For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along  with the Panchayat and health and sanitation committee. While developing a  plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of the poor of your  community. Share their feelings and opinions, and make sure that whatever  decision is taken to develop the health plan, reflects their voices. If some  segment of the community has shared that the source of  drinking water is  not accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion while  developing a comprehensive health plan for the village. 
As a leader some of the skills you need to build are 

 
Communication 

 
Decision-making 


Negotiation 


Coordination
