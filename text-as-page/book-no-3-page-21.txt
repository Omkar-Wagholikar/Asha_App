Tubectomy (female sterilization)  
Tying and cutting the tubes that carry eggs (egg-tubes) is tubectomy. There   are several ways of doing this procedure. In many states this operation   is done using laparoscope (doorbeen). It blocks the meeting of ovum and   sperms. This is a popular sterilization method in India.  

Two methods of tubectomy 

Mini-laparotomy is the conventional method 
This involves opening the abdomen through a small incision and operating   by hand. Local anaesthesia is given by injection.  
The mini-lap method needs hospitalization for two days. It is useful for   post-childbirth tubectomy, when the womb is still high in the abdomen   and easy to reach. 

Laparoscopy 
This involves inserting a laparoscope into the abdomen and applying tight   plastic rings on the tubes. Laparoscopy can only be performed when the   womb returns to its normal size and position (at least six weeks after   childbirth).  
Although tubectomy performed by an experienced surgeon is usually   successful, laproscopic sterilization may sometimes fail. 
Complications are rare in case of tubectomy; sometimes there may be   internal bleeding, infections, and possible tubal (ectopic) pregnancy later   if a tube happens to reopen.  
In cases of major complications attributable to sterilization, failure and   unlikely event of death, you should help in accessing compensation   available as per FP insurance scheme. You will get more information   from your ANM. 

Reversing sterilization (recanalization)  
For all practical purposes, sterilization operations are permanent procedures.   But, in unusual circumstances like death of all children, recanalization to   join the cut ends of tubes together can be adopted by the couple. But in   both men and women, only one in four such procedures succeed. These   facilities are available in big hospitals only.
