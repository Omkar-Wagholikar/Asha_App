Your responsibilities:  

Young people may have several questions about their body, sex and sexuality,   and how to remain healthy. Sexuality refers to expression of sexual feelings.   There is attraction towards opposite sex. They need information, and   services.  

You should inform and help the adolescents in getting services through the   nearest government hospital, i.e., for health care and also during pregnancy,   institutional delivery, access to contraceptives and services for RTIs/STIs   and menstrual problems.  

Males also need information and advice.  

You may like to visit schools and talk to the young on these issues.  

Alternatively, you can plan the visit of nurse didi to come to school and   talk to the adolescents. 

If there are any adolescent groups in the village, you should meet them   periodically. You may provide information on health issues and seek their   cooperation and support in our health work. You may also be required to   go with them to the sub-centre or PHC for health services.  

Adolescents need support in the community. You can talk to Panchayat   members, teachers, parents, local leaders and SHG members to provide   information on the subject. 

You need to find out if Anganwadi Centres run a programme for adolescent   girls: called Kishori Shakti Yojana. Adolescent girls receive more food under   this scheme. 

Talk with adolescents in the meetings of Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan   (NYKS), Yuvati Mandals and other youth groups on promoting health and   preventing diseases.
