Reasons for heart attack 

The heart pumps blood through blood vessels to supply oxygen to all parts of our body.   Factors such as age, family history and eating high fat diets can cause fat to settle in the   calls of the blood vessels. This can cause the vessel to become narrow or blocked and   reduce the blood flow. This leads to a heart attack.
