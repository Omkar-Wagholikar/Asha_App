Introduction: The  ASHA Learning  Programme 

Learning programme for ASHA is based on principles of adult learning. ASHAs  after taking up and completing this learning programme will be equipped with  necessary knowledge and skills to effectively perform the tasks and activities  expected from her. 
You will have the learning programme completed during five exposures  spread over the entire year and is to be completed during specified 23 days.  Each ASHA will receive reference material in form of books during the  learning programme.  
There are 19 themes to be covered in the 23 days learning programme. These  are listed in the chart given in next page. Each theme has some lessons. Each  lesson is complete by itself. We learn the 19 themes, lesson by lesson during  each learning exposure. Some themes having few lessons only may not spread  over all five learning exposures. The reading material specific to each lesson and  themes has been organized in the form of books. You have in your hands book  no 1. Similarly books no. 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be available in the subsequent  learning exposures.
