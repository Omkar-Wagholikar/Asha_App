It is very important that you visit your nearby sub-center and PHC regularly to  learn whether these centres are providing quality basic health services. Your  visit needs to be well-planned. We have given a checklist in Annexure 1, which  you should carry while visiting these centres. Observe the aspects mentioned  in this checklist. If you observe that the PHC and sub-centre are not providing  quality health care services you have a right to discuss the same with the  medical officer in-charge and the ANM. If you do not get proper responses  from them you can go to the Block Health Officer or Chief Medical Officer  and bring your concerns to their notice. Make a note of the names of all the  people with whom you speak.
