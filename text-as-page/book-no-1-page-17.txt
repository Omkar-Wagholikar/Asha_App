Find effective ways of how people learn to change their ways. 

Use any of these occasions for BCC: group discussion, personal discussion,  demonstration, village meetings, clinic contacts, exhibition, camps, Self  Help Group (SHG) meetings, meetings of adolescents, religious gatherings,  haat-bazaar days etc. 

Use aids for BCC: Chitrakatha, flip charts, booklets, posters, prabhat pheris,  songs, models, puppet shows, street plays etc 

Look for innovative methods in communication. For instance, one voluntary  organization painted all the bulls in the village with health slogans on the  traditional bail-puja day. The moving slogans stayed for weeks. 

Assess impact of BCC efforts. Has it changed how people think? Has  it changed the way they do things? Has it improved utilization of  health services? 

Enable people to change their behaviour such as construction of sanitary  latrines in their house. 
And remember all advice is good if you can follow it in similar situations. You  will learn more about BCC in this programme.
