Delivery occurs normally after nine months of pregnancy. If delivery is   before time special care for baby may be needed. As far as possible a   pregnant woman should have the delivery in a health centre or hospital   even if pregnancy is normal. This is mainly because during delivery, labour   complications may suddenly occur which can threaten the life of mother,   baby or both. During delivery the time between starting of a problem to   death of mother, baby or both is so short that it may not be possible to   save the life of mother or baby if the pregnant woman is not already in   a well-equipped health centre or hospital.
