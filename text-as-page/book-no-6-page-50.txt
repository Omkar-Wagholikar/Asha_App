i. Eye care  Skill checklist for applying eye ointment  
If a newborn has pus discharging from its eyes you can put antibiotic   ointment in the baby’s eyes or a capsule which is available in the market.  
How to put antibiotic ointment: 
Gently pull the baby’s lower eyelid down. 
Squeeze a thin line of ointment moving from the inside corner to the   outside of the eye. 
Do not touch the baby’s eye with the tip of the tube. If the tube touches the   babies eyes, it shouldn’t be used again. 
If the eyes are swollen with pus, then put the ointment two times a day for   5 days. 
Remember:  
The usual bathroom scales cannot reliably record small   diﬀ erences in weights. That is why bathroom scales cannot   accurately record newborn weight and it is not advisable to   use these for weighing newborns.
