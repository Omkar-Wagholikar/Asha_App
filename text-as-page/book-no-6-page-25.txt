Where are ANC services provided?   The nearest place for ANC services for a woman is at the AWC during the   monthly VHND. The pregnant woman could also go to the Sub-Centre,   where the ANM will provide ANC services. ANC services are also provided   at the PHC or Community Health Centre (CHC) or district hospital.   
Identification of problems and danger signs  Given below are complications that can occur during the antenatal period for   which pregnant women must seek treatment in an institution: 
Jaundice, high blood pressure, fever with chills, or bleeding 
Severe anaemia 
Women with protein and sugar in their urine 
Swelling of feet, face and hands. 
Given below are danger signs for which pregnant women must seek delivery   in a centre where they can manage complications including those requiring   surgery and blood transfusion. 
Mothers who had a complication in a previous pregnancy   (C section, prolonged labour, stillborn, neonatal death) 
Pregnant women with severe anaemia. 
Pregnant women having any of the danger signs of the antenatal period   which are still persisting at the time of delivery. 
Some women are to be considered more at risk of developing complications   during delivery and therefore,  must  opt for an institutional delivery. These   include:  
Young mothers (below 19 years of age) 
Mothers who are over 40 years of age 
Mothers who already have three children 
Mothers who have excessive weight gain or do not gain enough weight. 

Key tasks to be undertaken during ANC 
List all pregnant women: Ensure that you cover the women in the poorest   families, and in any sections which tend to get le  out, e.g. women from   SC/ST communities, women living in hamlets far from the main village,   or in hamlets that fall between villages and newly migrant women.  
Educate pregnant women about care in pregnancy, especially on the   importance of increased nutrition, rest, and complete ANC services.
