You can help in preventing HIV/AIDS 
Prevention of HIV/AIDS is the only effective way of escape through this   deadly disease. Following points are important:  

Creating awareness in community about risk and causation and advising   men and women to avoid sex with many persons. 

Consistent and correct use of condoms to prevent infection. 

Counsel for HIV testing. 
Women are caregivers for the family. When they are HIV positive, they may   not get the required family support and care. Counselling for the family   is very important. Emphasize use of condom and partner management,   early detection and treatment of STIs. In some hospitals there are special   services for pregnant women. This involves counselling, blood tests and   provision of drugs to HIV positive mothers. This will reduce the risk of   infection to the baby. Awareness among adolescent boys and girls about   healthy family life including sex education is important. 
Blood testing facilities are available at most district hospitals. Here blood   test for HIV/AIDS is done along with counselling services.
