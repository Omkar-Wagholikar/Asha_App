Objectives of the session 
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about:  
Know signs of malnutrition in a sick child. 
Be able to classify grades of malnutrition.  
Be able to plot weight for age on a growth chart.  

2. Assessment of Malnutrition  

ALL  sick children should be assessed for signs suggesting malnutrition.   

Check for Malnutrition 
Look and Feel:  
Look for visible severe wasting. 
Look for oedema of both feet. 
Determine grade of malnutrition by plo� ing weight for age (with AWW). 

Identifying Visible Severe Wasting 
A child with visible severe wasting is very thin, has no fat, and looks like   skin and bones. Some children are thin but do not have visible severe   wasting. This assessment step helps you in identifying the children with   visible severe wasting who need urgent treatment and  referral to a hospital . 
To look for visible severe wasting, remove the child’s clothes. Look for severe   wasting of the muscles of the shoulders, arms, bu� ocks and legs. Look at the   child from the side to see if the fat of the bu� ocks is missing. When wasting is   extreme, there are many folds of skin on the bu� ocks and thigh.  
The face of a child with visible severe wasting may still look normal. The   child’s abdomen may be large or distended. 
Look and feel to determine if the child has swelling of both feet. Use your   thumb to press gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot.   The child has oedema if a dent remains in the child’s foot when you li�    your thumb. 

Determine Grade of Malnutrition 
The AWW uses a growth monitoring chart for every child .  Every child in the   village should be weighed and his/her weight plo� ed on the growth chart.   There is a separate chart for boys and for girls under the age of ﬁ ve years.  
How to plot weight for age and identify malnutrition:  The le�  hand vertical line is the measure of the child’s weight. 
The bo� om line of the chart shows the child’s age in months.
