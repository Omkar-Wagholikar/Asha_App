Vitamin ‘A’ Deficiency  
Vitamin A is important for normal vision though in very small amounts. It   is not possible for even that amount to be synthesized in the body. Vitamin   A deficiency is most common between six months and three years. It can   even cause even blindness. Night blindness is an earliest symptom.  

Iron deficiency anaemia 
In children it is very common because of inadequate diet and recurrent   infections and worm infestations. Give one small iron tablet daily for 100   days in a year to children under five years.
