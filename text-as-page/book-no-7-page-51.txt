1. High Risk Assessment and Management of Low Birth   Weight/Pre-Term Babies 

Identifying a high risk baby and what to do? 

Objectives of the session 
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about:  
Diagnose which babies are at high risk. 
Diagnose and refer high risk children. 
Counsel the mother on how to breastfeed a pre-term/Low Birth Weight   (LBW) newborn. 
Teach mothers to express milk and feed such babies using a bowl   or spoon. 

Guidelines for ASHA on identifying a high risk baby 
Birth weight less than 2000 gm. 
Pre-term (delivery which happens when mother is 8 months and 14 days   pregnant or less). 
Baby not taking feeds on Day 1. 
If you were not present at the time of delivery and your ﬁ rst visit to the   newborn is delayed, then the newborn is to be weighed on the day of your   ﬁ rst visit. In such cases, using the following table, determine whether the   baby is high risk or not: 

Day on which baby is   weighed for the first   time 
Weight of baby  Diagnosis 
1 to 14 days  Less than 2 kg  High Risk Baby 
15 to 21 days  Less than 2 kg 100 gm  High Risk Baby 
22 to 27 days  Less than 2 kg 200 gm  High Risk Baby 
28th day  Less than 2 kg 300 gm  High Risk Baby
