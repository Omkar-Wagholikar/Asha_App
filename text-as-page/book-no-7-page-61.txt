Community Level Care for Malaria in Areas where Malaria is endemic  

Malaria 

Malaria is an infection caused by parasite (microorganism) called   Plasmodium. This is transmi ed by the female anopheles mosquito. There are   two types of malaria: Vivax and Falciparum. Vivax is not very dangerous but   falciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs.  
How does it spread?:  When the mosquito bits an infected person, the parasite   enters the mosquitos stomach. It multiplies in the insects stomach and then   when it bites another person, the parasite enters the blood of the person along   with the insects saliva and infects him/her .  

Signs and Symptoms 
The patient can have fever, high shivering and sweating, which can occur   on alternate days (in Vivax type of malaria) and every day at a certain   time with Falciparum type infection.  
Sometimes the patient has continuous fever, malaise, and headache. 
Malaria a ects more frequently and more severely children below  ve   years, pregnant women, or patients who are already ill.  
Falciparum malaria can a ect the brain: causing clouding of   consciousness,  ts, or paralysis leading to death.
