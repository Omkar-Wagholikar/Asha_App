Organs and systems 
Like we build our house, nature has built our bodies. For a house we need  stones, bricks, mud and cement, wood, tins or roof, tiles, pipes  and wires etc. From these we build foundation, pillars, walls,  rooms, windows, doors, floors, water supply, lighting, kitchen  chulha, drainage etc. All these parts have different purposes.  Similarly in the body we have many parts or organs for  different functions. Together they make the human body. 
Different organs doing different work are linked together  as organ systems. Various systems do various tasks  necessary for life. So we have systems for breathing, blood  circulation, digestion, movement, waste management etc. And all the body  systems work in cooperation. The body has control systems for this, viz brain,  nerves and hormones. 
Bones and muscles make the frame and walls. This also makes movement  possible. Small and big, we have about 206 bones in the body of different  shapes. About 100 bones are just in our hands and feet. The joints make  movement possible. Hips, knees, shoulder, elbow wrists, ankle are all joints. And  joints are so different.
