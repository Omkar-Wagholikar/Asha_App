Annexe 4: Technique for performing rapid diagnostic test 

Procedure 
Check that the test kit is within its expiry date. If not discard it. Read   the instructions of the test kit, as there may be minor variations in the   procedure between di erent kits. Place a small box, jar or bo le for trash   next to the kit.  
Open a foil pouch and check that the desiccant inside it is still blue. If not,   discard the test. 
Remove the test strip and the small glass tube or loop from the foil pouch   and place them on a clean dry surface. 
Take out the bu er solution and the dropper. Place a new test tube in the   multiple well plate. 
Clean a  nger with the swab and let the skin dry completely in the air.   Prick  nger on the side with a lancet. Place lancet in trash container. Let a   drop of blood come out on the skin.  
Touch the tip of the glass tube or the loop to the blood drop on the  nger   and let a small quantity of blood (a small drop) come up in the tube or the   loop. 
Touch the tube or the loop to the test strip just below the arrow mark to   place the blood there. If there is a paper, where Plasmodium falciparum   is wri en, remove it and place the blood, where it was. Place tube/loop in   trash container. 
Using the dropper, place 4 drops of bu er solution into a new test tube.   A er this, place the test strip containing blood in the bu er solution with   the arrow pointing down. While waiting, a slide can be prepared.
