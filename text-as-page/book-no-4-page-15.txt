Presumptive (inital) treatment for malaria fever 

It should be given to all fever cases if malaria is suspected after taking   blood film wherever possible. 

It should be given to all persons irrespective of age and sex including   infants and pregnant women. 

This is done to destroy the malaria parasites in the blood and give   relief to the person having malaria. 

Certain cases of malaria   can be life-threatening   and hence to have radical   treatment after presumptive   (initial) treatment is   important 

Anti-malarial drugs should   not be taken on empty   stomach. 

National Vector Bone Disease Control Programme 
The following anti-malaria activities are undertaken by government health   facilities: 

Blood sample of patient with fever is collected by the Multi-Purpose   Worker (MPW)/ANM. Thick and thin blood smear are made and   confirmed for malaria parasite. 

If found to be positive, the radical (final) treatment is given free of cost   on doctors/health workers advice. The drugs given are Chloroquine   and Primaquine. 

Primaquine should not be given to infants and pregnant women 
Whenever a case of fever is seen without any other sign/symptom   such as rash/diarrhoea/cough etc. always consider it to be malaria. Give   treatment on that basis.
