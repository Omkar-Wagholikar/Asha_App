Is white discharge normal? 
Some amount of white discharge is normal. It is the vagina’s way of   cleansing itself.  
The amount of discharge varies during diﬀ erent phases of the menstrual   cycle. During the fertile period it is wet and slippery, and clear.  
During pregnancy, the discharge increases in amount. 
Discharge that is bad smelling (smell of menstrual blood, ﬁ shy odour),   white lumpy discharge (curd, coloured greenish, yellowish, reddish,   bloody), accompanied by itching, a rash, sores, burning urination, and   lower abdominal pain, pain during intercourse is indicative of RTI or STI.  
A change in colour and odour is an alert to the women of a possible   infection. In addition, if there is itching or burning, there is high   possibility of an infection.  
Discharge is also indicative of certain hormonal problems or even cancer. 

What are STIs?  
STIs are infections that are passed from an infected person to another during   sexual intercourse. Mothers can pass on STIs to babies during the delivery   process.  
Most STIs are RTIs. However a few like Hepatitis-B and HIV are STIs but not   RTIs. Many Reproductive Tract Infections are Sexually Transmi� ed Infections.   However many other Reproductive Tract Infections are contracted by other   means e.g. post childbirth or abortion or from GI infections.  

Why are STIs serious problem for women?  
Because the infected semen stays longer inside a women’s body.  
The entire genital tract in women is hidden, therefore, the infection stays   inside for a longer time and is silent for longer.
