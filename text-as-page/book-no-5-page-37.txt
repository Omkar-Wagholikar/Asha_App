Leaders achieve unity 

As a leader you need to promote unity among your community members and  between the community members and health care providers. Unity can be  achieved by listening to everyones points of view while taking decisions. Do  not make anyone feel neglected since later they may become difficult persons  to manage. 
Unity comes when community members feel the ownership of the goal that  you have set as an ASHA for your village. 

Leaders serve as  role models 

Leaders have followers. Therefore, it is very important that all your actions  are responsible. 
For example, as an ASHA you are assigned the role of accompanying a  pregnant woman for a referral. If you performed this role and saved the life  of woman in your village, you have set an example. Next time, when the  need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a  pregnant woman during an emergency. They may also arrange for money and  transport, if required. 

Leader listen and explain 

Listening helps to make the process of decision-making easier and more  meaningful. Also, the as a leader you  need to articulate and explain your  point of view. 
For example, at the village level families are not proactive in preparing for  the birth of a child. You need to listen to them about the reasons for their  lack of motivation. Based on their views, explain to them the need for birth  preparedness and the likely consequences of poor birth preparedness. Share  positive examples where birth preparedness has helped to save a womans  life.
