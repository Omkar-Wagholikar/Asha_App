Values of  ASHA 

For every individual, values are the central guiding force for all behaviour and  attitudes. Culture, experience, education, religion, law, language and media  influence values. It is also important to know that values can change. While  working on social issues, we are basically working with the attitudes and  behaviours of the community and the programme implementors for a positive  and desired change. Hence, it becomes very important to address the values  of individuals for social development. 
Every individual has her/his own values. There is nothing like right or wrong.  Generally, they are received from our parents, our society and our  surroundings. Values shape our personality and  identity and are directly  connected with our vision of life. They guide us to decide our goal and act on  it. For example, If I know the destination that I have to reach, I can always  choose the correct path when I come to a crossroads. 
Without a clear sense of purpose and values, we are  lost and confused. For  example, whether to spend time in gossiping or in my work will depend on my  values. 
Values remain in the subconscious mind and act like red and green traffic  lights.They tell us what we should or should not do. Values are a set of beliefs  about what is good and desirable. They are based on assumptions about how  the world works. Our idea of what is the right thing to do in a situation  comes from these values.
