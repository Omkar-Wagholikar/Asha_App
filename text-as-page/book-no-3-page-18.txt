Safe period 
Women with menstrual cycle between 26 and   32 days can prevent pregnancy by avoiding   unprotected sexual intercourse on days 8 to 19,   taking the day of starting of menstrual cycle as   day one. You should know more about standard   days method from your ANM. 

Cervical mucus method 
The opening of the womb of the woman has a   sticky fluid called cervical mucus. Typically the mucus is thin and sticky   for two days before and after ovulation, which allows   for easy passage of the sperm. This is the fertile period.   In other days the mucus is thick, dry and breaks on   stretching. These days are infertile. 
These natural methods need a lot of self-control and   have a very high failure rate. Therefore it is advisable   to adopt other contraceptive methods that have   low failure rate in case the woman does not desire   pregnancy. 
However, fertility awareness of a woman is desirable in case of couples   with the problem of infertility to increase their chances of conception in   many cases.

If a woman has not conceived so far, fertility awareness can help in timing   the sexual intercourse and increase their chance of conception.
