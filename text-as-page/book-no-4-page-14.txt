Malaria is an illness caused   by the presence of malarial   parasite in the human body.   It spreads through the bite of   mosquito. When a mosquito   bites a person suffering from   malaria, the parasite enters   the body of the mosquito.   When the infected mosquito   bites a healthy person then   he/she may develop malaria.  
A  person  with  malaria generally has fever with chills daily/alternate day, generally with headache, bodyache and vomiting. The fever comes down with   profuse sweating and leaves the person with generalized weakness   and discomfort.
