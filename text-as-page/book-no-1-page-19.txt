Counseling needs knowledge of the subject. Knowledge grows with time and  more reading and discussing. Counseling also needs skills about talking with  different personsmen and women, young and old etc., understanding their  viewpoints. It calls for sensitivity and empathy. 
Counseling also needs motivating skills. Different problems involve different  solutions. Therefore motivating becomes necessary. We often do it in the  family. This is how we arrive at a decision after weighing pros and cons of  several alternatives. 
You can also do effective counseling after some experience. 

Escorting patients to a hospital 
Many people need to go to a town or city hospital for higher care. They feel lost  and helpless in such situations. Often, they face difficulties in such situations.  Also somebody from the family has to stay back to look after children and  cattle, getting money, farm work etc. They often need you to accompany them. 
You can ensure that needy people get the right help. You also can help in  deciding to go at the PHC, Community Health Centre (CHC) or the district  hospital. If the CHC is far away, people may choose to go to other suitable  private or trust hospital. In some emergency situations (like bleeding during or  immediately after birth) time is precious. Situations that need escorting are: 

Childbirth and immediately after childbirth, difficulties during pregnancy  and childbirth. 

Abortion and bleeding 

A seriously sick child 

A very sick person, like brain malaria. Heat stroke 

Someone wants to know about his/her TB or suspect HIV 

Accidents like snake bite, burns, serious injury, poisoning, drowning 

Clients for accepting IUD or sterilization. 

You need to have necessary information and skills. 
Knowledge about which hospital to take to. What is the distance? 
Help family in decision-making. You need to decide with the family about  where to go.
