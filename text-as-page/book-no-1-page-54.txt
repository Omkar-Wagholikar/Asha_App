The PHC doctor has many tasks to do. Treatment of illnesses is just one. He also  has meetings to attend and he may also be required to conduct post-mortems. 
PHC doctors treat illnesses in the Out Patient Department (OPD). Some patients  are admitted in the PHC. Sub center health workers refer patients to PHC. The  PHC may also refer some patients to the CHC or District hospital. Some patients  may need to go to the district hospital. 
Each PHC doctor also visits sub centres covered by that PHC. Doctor has to  supervise work of nursediddi, meet villagers and also provide services. 

We can do this 
Inform people about the facilities available at these health centers. For  instance, talk of childbirth or TB treatment and free care.   
Motivate people to use available services at the health centers. 
Discuss with the doctor or nurse about the health problems of your village  community. Inform them about unusual health problems in your village.
