A Kitchen garden 
Kitchen garden is a way to use wastewater to produce vegetables for  ourselves. The plants use up the water and we get fresh vegetables at no  extra cost. What we need is only some place to do  this. The vegetables we can grow are:  fenugreek,   spinach,   dhaniya,   carrots,  tomatoes, gourds, lentils etc. We can have  about 20 varieties of vegetables. We  should also grow commonly available  medicinal herbs such as Tulsi, Kumari,  Podina etc alongwith vegetables for use  of common ailments. 
If we have more waste water, perennial  trees, fruits and plants like drumstick, mango,  guava, lime, papaya and banana Most people like  fruits and we certainly need them for vitamins and minerals. 

Making a Soak pit 
Soak pit must be used to avoid pools of water, particularly in the streets and  common pathways. 
We can construct a soak pit near our house and around public places. This will  absorb drumfuls of water without forming a pool. This will avoid breeding  places for mosquitoes. 
Dig a pit of 1.5 meter length, breadth and depth. At the bottom put loose stones  and brickbats. After filling 1/3 of the pit put smaller  half size brickbats. Fill 1/3 of the pit thus. Fill  the top third of the pit even smaller  brickbats. 
We need to avoid rain water from  entering the pit. For this raise its  borders by 10 centimeters above the  ground level. Fill it with dry grass or  coconut coir on top. Better put a used  earthen pot at top, with hole in bottom.
