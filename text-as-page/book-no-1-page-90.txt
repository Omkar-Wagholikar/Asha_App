IMMUNIZATION 

Make sure 
Immunization card is given for each child by the health  worker and to be kept safely for further follow up. The  child gets full immunization in time. Parents should  bring the child for immunization as per schedule.  Only complete immunization protects the child fully.  Partial immunization does not protect and gives false  sense of protection. 
Some   people   have   misconceptions   about  immunization. You need to dispel these. For instance  some people feel that immunization is harmful to babies. Or  it causes fever and therefore illness. Another misconception is that  immunization should not be done if the child is sick. Ask your nursedidi  about questions raised by the parents about immunization.
