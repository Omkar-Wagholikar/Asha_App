on drugs in Book 1. Give tablet Paracetamol for two days. For high   fever, tepid water sponging is good first aid, with Paracetamol tablets.   If fever doesnt come down with in two days, refer to the nearest   health facility. Sponge the whole body with tepid water. Do not use   cold water as it causes shivers. Do not give a blanket. Keep windows   open 

Give enough water and fluids to drink. 

Light meals like khichadi, daal-rice, curd, dalia are soft and easily   digested. 

Fever is the symptom of a disease. It is not a disease in itself.   Paracetamol tablet or syrup is general remedy for fever. It only brings   down the temperature. It is not a fever-cure since it does not kill the   causative germs. For common colds and coughs, Paracetamol or herbal   remedies are good enough and no other treatment is necessary.  

Some home remedies for fever 
Home remedies soothe the effects of fever. Give her: 

Gulvel kadha 
Take a thumb thick piece of Gulvel. Add two-teaspoonful powder of dry   ginger. Add 10-12 glasses of water. Boil on slow fire. When three glass full   decoction remains, cool it. Give half a glass of freshly made decoction. 

China grass tea 
Tea prepared with China grass is a refreshing decoction for someone   suffering from simple fever.  

Specific treatment for illness 
For illnesses due to various germs we need to give specific medicines.   Malaria, pneumonia, TB, etc need specific medicines other than Paracetamol.   However viral illnesses have no specific remedies. Virus is a very small   germ causing many fever-illnesses. Common cold, flu, dengue, jaundice   etc are viral illnesses.  
Remember several serious illnesses may be connected with fever e.g.,   malaria, pneumonia, pus (anywhere) typhoid, TB, kala azar, filariasis, brain   fever, HIV/AIDS etc. We will learn about them. As a thumb rule, do not   wait for more than two days for cure.
