Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) in men  

The urethral discharge  
The complaint of urethral discharge is very common in men. Germs are   the only cause of any pus from urethra. The most common germ causes   yellow/white pus bead in the morning before first urine is passed. It is   not always painful. Untreated, it causes bad kinks in the urethra and   chronic infection. Men with such a complaint should consult a qualified   doctor immediately.  

Prevention 

For prevention, the best policy is to avoid multiple sex partners, or   risky sex behaviour. 

Early and complete treatment cures the infection and stops the spread   to the next partner.  

Sex is best avoided during treatment. 

Educate people on this illness and remove undue fears about them.   This may save them hundreds and thousands of rupees. 

It is important to examine and treat the spouse or partner, as he/she   will be infected also. 
The spouse/partner may already have had this infection and illness in form   of vaginal discharge and burning during urination. The infection may get   inside the womb and cause pain and fever. It may become chronic if not   treated early and properly. Therefore, always ask for any complaints, which   the woman partner may have.
