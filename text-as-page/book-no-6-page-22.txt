1. Pregnancy Diagnosis  

Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as possible a� er the ﬁ rst missed period.  

There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early: 
• Missed Periods 
• Pregnancy testing: through use of the Nischay home pregnancy test card  

The Nischay test card can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant.  

The test can be done immediately a� er the missed period.  

A positive test means that the woman is pregnant.  

The beneﬁ t of early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be   registered early by the ANM and start ge� ing antenatal care soon.  

A negative test means that the woman is not pregnant. In case she is not   pregnant and does not want to get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt   a family planning method. 

The result of the test should be kept conﬁ dential. 
Instructions for the use of the Nishcay Kit are in Annexe 2.
