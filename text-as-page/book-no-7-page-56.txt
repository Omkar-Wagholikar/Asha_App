4. Neonatal Sepsis: Diagnosis and Manage-  ment 

How common is sepsis and how serious? 
 In rural India, one out of every ten newborns   develops sepsis.  
 Sepsis in the ﬁ rst month of life is very serious, and is   the most common killer of newborns in the ﬁ rst month of life. 
 Without treatment, many babies with sepsis will die; with treatment, most   babies will get be� er, live and grow up normally. 

Causes of neonatal sepsis 
 Mother has infection during pregnancy or delivery. 
 Unclean techniques during delivery (poor handwashing, use of unclean   blade or cord ties) can cause sepsis.
