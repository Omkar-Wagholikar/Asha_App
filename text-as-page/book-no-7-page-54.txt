3. Asphyxia Diagnosis and Management 

What is Asphyxia? 

A baby having any one of the following symptoms at the time of birth is   asphyxiated:  
No cry 
Weak cry 
No breathing 
Weak breathing. 

If a baby has asphyxia, it is an Emergency. A life can be saved or lost in these    ve minutes. If you are present at the time of birth, and there is no doctor or   nurse, you should try to help to manage the baby. However, in many such   newborns, your e orts may not make enough di erence and you should not   feel bad or blame yourself for this. Depending on the area in which you work,   you may be trained in using a bag and mask to treat asphyxia as in Annexe 3. 

Consequences of Asphyxia
