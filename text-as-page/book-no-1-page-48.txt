Organising  A Group Meeting  Organising  A Group Meeting 

In this lesson we will learn about one way of communication —  Group meetings. You have to match the group, topic and method  of communication. Mismatch of these three will not produce any  impact. For instance for bringing behavioral change about  sanitary latrine, we need to talk to women (and men). 
We can plan and do it as follows: 
Get a group of 5-10 women/men (not more) in  somebody’s house. It is good to select a  venue which is accessible to all  especially women from scheduled  castes/ tribes are comfortable. It is  useful to select a house, which  already have a sanitary latrine. 
You need to communicate to people  in advance about the venue and  timing of this meeting. You can also  talk with members of self help group in  the village.
