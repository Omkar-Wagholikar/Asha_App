A saying on health 
Pehla such Nirogi Kaya  is one of the saying. It means healthy body is the most  important pleasure of life. 
Good health leads to productive, happy, and a long life. Both  the body and mind need to be healthy. And our relation with  the society should also be healthy. People often think health  is linked to medicines, doctors and hospitals only. This is not  always true. 
Hospitals and doctors are necessary when we fall sick. But  first we need to take care of our body. You can prevent  diseases, promote health and prolong life. 
We say  Aarogyam dhansampada . This means health is real wealth. Health  makes us more productive, and ill health causes losses. Ill health keeps us  away from work and livelihood. Ill health means spending on doctors and  medicines. In villages, people often take loans or sell goats and cattle to  pay for hospital expenses. The money people spend on tobacco and liquor  also causes ill health. Following health practices protect our wealth and  increase productivity.
