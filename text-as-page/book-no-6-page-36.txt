Before Delivery 

The delivery room should be   cleaned before the delivery.   If the delivery is happening at   home, you should facilitate a   clean delivery space.  
Immediately after birth, if the   baby remains naked, it may   become cold. Hence, baby   clothes should be kept ready   before delivery.  

1st Stage of labour 
Starts from the beginning of pain until the mouth of the womb is fully open. This   happens inside and cannot be seen. The bag of water also breaks at the end of   this stage. The fluid is usually clear but may be yellow or green or red. If green, it   indicates infection. 
This first stage of labour usually lasts about 8 to 12 hours in the first pregnancy.   May take much less time in subsequent pregnancies.
