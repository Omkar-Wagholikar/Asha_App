Immunization is one of the most well-known and cost effective methods   of preventing diseases. Though most of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases   (VPDs) are controlled by now, immunization has to be sustained, not only   to prevent VPDs, but also   a) to eliminate Tetanus,   b) reduce the incidence of Measles and   c) eradicate Poliomyelitis.

DPT Immunization 


 Tetanus 


 Poliomyelitis 


 Diphtheria 


 Pertussis (whooping cough)

 Childhood tuberculosis 
The vaccines must be given at the right age, right dose, right interval and the   full course must be completed to ensure the best possible protection to the   child against these diseases. The schedule that tells us when and how many   doses of each vaccine are to be given is called immunization schedule.
