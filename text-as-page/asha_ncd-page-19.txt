Why do People use Tobacco and Alcohol? 

Many people start smoking/chewing tobacco and consuming alcohol in their early   twenties or even earlier. Adolescents may begin to use tobacco or alcohol in order to act   older, or as a way of experimenting, to gain social acceptance among peers, or in stressful   situations. Adults begin to smoke and drink to either overcome stress or pressures of daily   life or for pleasure. Individuals react differently to the amount of alcohol they drink. While   some individuals experience ill effects with even small quantities of alcohol, others can   consume larger quantities without any harmful effects appearing immediately.  
It is also important to remember that in some parts of our country, drinking alcohol is   part of the local tradition. Your task is to understand the harmful consequences of the use   of these substances and communicate this to the people of your community.
