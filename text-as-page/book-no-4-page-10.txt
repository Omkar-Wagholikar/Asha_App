Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It occurs   commonly in lungs but can occur in different parts of our body i.e.   intestines, kidneys, bones etc. There may be about 15 to 25 confirmed cases   of TB in your village. Please ensure that   all of them are identified and registered   for treatment. 
Lung TB spreads by air. When a patient of   TB coughs or sneezes, the bacteria enters   the body of other persons who breathe   that air. However, TB can spread to other   parts of the body too. In women, TB of   reproductive organs can cause infertility.

Persistent cough for more than three weeks especially with sputum
