2. Breastfeeding Low Birth Weight/Pre-Term babies 

Advantages of breast milk for LBW and pre-term Babies 
Has the right nutrients for the pre-term/LBW baby 
Pre-term babies need more protein and a mother who has delivered   pre-term has more breast milk. 
Is easily digestible. 
Contains factors to ﬁ ght infection (small babies are more vulnerable   to disease). 
Breastfeeding keeps the baby close to the mother and therefore, warm.   This protects the pre-term baby from cold (Hypothermia), which can lead   to infection. 

Key Messages 

For small babies who can suckle 
Try the underarm hold for more support or the alternate underarm hold. 

If sleeping, wake baby every 2-3 hours for breastfeeding by rubbing a   damp cloth over its face. 

For babies who are not able to suckle:  
Babies less than 1500 gm may not be able to breastfeed in the beginning. 
Express milk by applying gentle pressure over entire breast and collect   milk in a clean bowl. 
Express milk every 2-3 hours to keep the milk supply up.  
Put baby to breast and allow her to lick the nipple, and try to suckle. 
Once the baby is able to suckle, she should be put to the breast as o� en as   possible to stimulate milk production. 
Continue feeding with the spoon as well until the baby is ge� ing its milk   requirements directly from the breast. 

How much to give? 
For a LBW baby: For ﬁ rst day 60 ml/kg body weight.  
Add 20 ml/kg body weight until baby is taking 200 ml per day. 
Divide the total into 8-12 feeds (every 2-3 hours). 
Colostrum can be kept for up to 12 hours at room temperature. 
Mature milk (a� er ﬁ rst 72 hours) can be kept for 6-8 hours at room temperature. 
Continue until baby can be fully breastfed.
