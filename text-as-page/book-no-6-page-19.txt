9. ASHA Support and Supervision  

• For ASHA to be eﬀ ective and for her skills to be   updated, she needs both on-the-job support and   refresher trainings.  
• Each ASHA will be supported in the ﬁ eld by an   ASHA facilitator. 
• The ASHA facilitator will interact with ASHA at   least twice if not thrice a month.  
• At least one of these interactions will be in the   form of a “mentoring” visit to the hamlet where   she provides her services. This would focus on   mentoring or on-the-job training.  
• Another one or two interactions would be in a local review meeting. This   could be held at Gram Panchayat (GP) level, or at the sector level or even   at the block level.  
• Each of the facilitators will have a clear protocol of activities to follow   for the mentoring visit to the ASHAs and for the review meetings. The   purpose of these interactions are: 
a   Collecting health related information as observed by ASHA and   information on what work ASHA is doing. 
b   For providing support to the ASHA to manage the health problems   they encounter. 
c   For providing training and refresh or update their knowledge and   skills. 
d For helping ASHAs plan their work. 
e   For building up mutual solidarity and motivation. 
f   For troubleshooting problems, especially as regards payments and   addressing grievances.  
g   For reﬁ lls to their drug kit 
• The Medical Oﬃ  cer In-charge of the block PHC/CHC should a� end at   least one monthly meeting of all ASHAs in the Primary Health Centre   (PHC) area, to review work progress.
