Infant and Young   Child Nutrition:   Breastfeeding and   Complementary Feeding 

10 

Nutrition is required for a child to grow, develop, and remain active   and to reach adulthood without illness. Nutrients such as carbohydrates,   fats, proteins are required in large amounts (macro nutrients), while   some nutrients e.g. Vitamins, Iron, Calcium, Iodine etc. are required in   minimum amounts (micro nutrients). Growth of the child can be assessed   by plotting height & weight for the age in Road to Health Chart. If the   child is not growing properly, it means the child is malnourished i.e. under   nourished.  
Nutrition in children is divided according to age as is given below: 

0-6 months exclusive breastfeeding  

Infants up to six months are to be exclusively   breast-fed. Feed at least eight times a day. 

Mothers should be encouraged to breast-feed   on demand. 

Bottle-feeding should be discouraged and   anxious mothers should be reassured.  

Breast milk is the ideal food for young infants   as it contains all nutrients.
