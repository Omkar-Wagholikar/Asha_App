How dangerous is the   bite? 
People will ask you if the   bite is dangerous. A bite   can cause illness only if the   animal itself is infected. First   symptoms of rabies in bitten   person may appear early   within 10 days or more after   the bite.  
Rabies infection is likely if a   pet dog dies within 10 days   of the bite or if it shows   any signs of rabies. Even   a scratch on the skin may give rabies infection. Each wound is   important. We can decide the risk of exposure as follows: 
Mild:  Licks on normal skin, scratches without blood, drinking raw milk of   suspect cattle. 
Moderate: Licks on fresh cuts, scratches with blood oozing, minor wounds   fewer than five, all wounds except those on face, neck, head, palms and   fingers. 
Severe:  All bites and scratches with oozing blood on neck, face, palms,   fingers, face and head, Lacerated wounds on any part of body, wounds   more than five, bites of wild animals. 
If the biting animal is not seen or around, the case should be treated as   severe. 
Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. The effect of ARV reduces   after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog-bite,   fresh vaccination is necessary.
