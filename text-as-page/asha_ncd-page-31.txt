What is Stress? 

Stress can be caused by family problems, poverty, dissatisfaction with job, unemployment,   pressure of work, grief and migration. It can affect the body (physical) or mind (mental) or   both. Prolonged stress may affect the overall health of a person and affect her/his family   as well.  
Stress may lead to digestive problems, back or neck pain, sleeping problems, substance   abuse, headaches, sleeplessness, depressed mood, anger and irritability. Stress   contributes to health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, ulcers, high blood pressure,   diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses. Handling stress depends on   an individual’s personality.

The role of ASHA in helping people to manage stress 

 Help individuals identify the cause of stress. 

 Understand that stress management varies from person to person. 

 Help such individuals to build supportive relationships - A positive   and stable bond between people that can provide emotional and social   support is important. Talk to the individual’s family members, friends,   community members to discuss the problem and reasons for stress.  

 Motivate these individuals to exercise regularly - Walking, practicing   yoga, jogging, etc. can all help improve mood and reduce stress. 

 Educate them to make positive changes in behaviour such as eating a   healthy diet, control of anger, managing depression, appreciating the   positives in oneself and others. 

 Help them seek care for health problems from an appropriate service   provider.
