Why is it Important to Check Blood Pressure even among those   without any Symptoms?  

Regular screening of blood pressure helps in making an early diagnosis of hypertension.   This is helpful in taking early corrective measures leading to better control of blood   pressure.  

Please Note:  A single high reading (more than normal) does not necessarily   mean that the person has high blood pressure. The measurement must be   repeated.
