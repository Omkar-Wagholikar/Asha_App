As per PNDT Act,   1. Detection of sex of foetus during pregnancy is illegal.   2. Termination of pregnancy after identifying the sex of the foetus as   female is also illegal.  
There are two methods of terminating   the pregnancy: 

Surgical abortion 
This is carried out by evacuating   the embryo either using a hand held   syringe or electric suction machine  

Medical abortion 
This is carried out by using pills 
In both cases, it has to be done by a qualified doctor in any approved   centre. Women undergoing MTP can get more details from PHC. There are   advantages/disadvantages of both methods. In both cases, there has to   be post-abortal care for the women undergoing MTP.  

Post-abortal care 

Follow up after abortion is a must especially after the tablets are   given for medical abortion.  

If the woman has any of the following symptoms, she should be   immediately referred to the nearest functional FRU/District hospital. 

Severe bleeding or foul smelling discharge from uterus 

Severe pain in abdomen 

Fever 

Swelling in the abdomen or severe vomiting  
Counselling of the women will help them to seek safe abortions which   will help in decreasing deaths among pregnant women. After an induced   abortion, a woman can become pregnant again within six weeks. Hence,   it is advisable for the woman (and her partner) to be counselled for   appropriate contraception and help them to get the suitable contraceptive   if they wish to adopt. 
It is important to remember: 

Termination of pregnancy below   20 weeks is legal under provision   of MTP Act.
