Decisions People Make 

Where should I go   for a safe delivery? 

Birth Micro Plan of ASHA/ANM/AWW 

I help every family with a pregnant   woman to make a birth plan.  
If she has any danger signs or complications, I will ask   her to go to the CHC or DH when her delivery is due.  I must also make arrangements to ensure that   the transport is ready and available at that time.  
But if she and her family do not want to go that far   and the 24X7 PHC is crowded, I will advise her to go to   the nearby sub-centre where two ANMs are trained to   conduct deliveries and one of them is always there. 
For some women, family circumstances and beliefs   make even going to the sub-centre diffi cult. I will then   get the ANM to come to her house, and will assist in the   preparations needed, after counselling that a safe delivery   in this situation may not always be possible.  
If I go to the PHC which is open 24 hours, I will be   cared for and can rest for two days. Also, if there   is any surgery needed, they can rush me to the big   hospital quickly. 

Womanâ€™s choice 

I will also need to ensure that I have an escort,   maybe the ASHA, to accompany me, and that   someone is taking care of the children and   things at home.  
If danger signs or complications develop before   the delivery, I will need to go to the big hospital   straight away, but I hope that does not happen. 
If she has no complications, I will counsel her to go   to the 24X7 PHC, and for this too, I must ensure that   transport arrangements are made in time.
