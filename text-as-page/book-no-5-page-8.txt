Think about the following questions. Answering them will help you in self-  reflection. More questions may be added. 

What are some of the difficulties that I face in order to complete my  work? 

What are some of the changes which I will practice if I have to deal with  this situation again? (The changes can be related to behaviour, way of  working, etc.) 

What did I do today for which I am not happy? Why? 

What did I do today which has made me happy? 
Remember, each day must contribute to your overall goals in some way. Each  day must in some way be connected to the rest of your life. Each day should  contribute to your general welfare, happiness and empowerment. This will  also contribute to the development of your community. We have 24 hours in a  day, out of which we spend about seven hours sleeping. Out of the remaining  17 hours, we need to think about how many we actually spend on self-  development. As an ASHA we suggest that you initially need atleast half an  hour everyday for yourself in order to grow and develop. You may increase  this period as you get more familiar with this practice. We need to plan for  our self-development from today. You may use the tools given here for help.
