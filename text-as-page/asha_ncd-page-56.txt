The role of the ASHA 

 You must remember that all cases who may have one or more signs   of cancer, may not actually have cancer. Several people who undergo   screening may have one sign or more,  but unless this is proved by biopsy,   it cannot be confirmed.  You must take care not to create a panic situation   by informing people that they have cancer before this is confirmed by a   medical doctor.  

 Cancer treatment is long and causes both emotional and financial stress   to the family. One of your tasks should be to support the family through   visits, helping them to access the services in the health system and   encourage the community to help them as required. 

 Encourage the patients undergoing cancer treatment to have fresh,   hygienic, well-cooked foods, avoid alcohol and tobacco in any form. 

 People receiving cancer treatment specially with medicines may have   a higher risk of acquiring infections. You can play an important role in   informing patients and families on adopting methods for preventing   infections. These include-tips for handwashing, body hygiene, oral   hygiene, and avoiding crowded places or covering the face with a mask   while in crowded places.  

 The cost of cancer treatment for poor patients is often free. Different   states have schemes that will take care of these costs. You should find out   what happens in your state, so that people in your community can get   access to reduced cost of care. 

Management of Cancers 

During screening, if an individual is found to have a sign that could indicate cancer, a test   called a biopsy would need to be taken done by a trained service provider.  

 Treatment for cancer can be provided at the district hospital, in the medical college or   in special centres created for treatment of cancer. 

 Treatment for cancer could be through surgery, medicines or radiotherapy (treatment   using X-rays).
