Mother 

Women with four or more children have greater risk of death during   childbirth. 

Similarly older women have more problems during childbirth. 

If adolescent girls get married early i.e. before 18 years they start having   children too soon. These girls are more likely to have complications or   can die during childbirth. Also children born to these mothers have   low birth weight and more likely to die in the first year.
