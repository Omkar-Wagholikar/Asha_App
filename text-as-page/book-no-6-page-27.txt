2. Birth Preparedness for a Safe Delivery 

What is Birth Preparedness?   This is a method of planning in advance by the pregnant   mother and her family for a safe and comfortable delivery   and for care a� er delivery. You should help every family   make this plan in consultation with the ANM. 
What are the choices available to the mother?   1.  If there are any danger signs or complications:  Identify the nearest institution (CHC/District Hospital)   which has the staﬀ  and equipment to provide   Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn   Care (CEmONC), and counsel the mother and the   family to go there.  
2.  If there are no complications:  Counsel the mother to go to the PHC which is   open 24 X 7, where there is a team of doctors and nurses or ANMs to conduct   the delivery and provide care for the mother and newborn. These institutions   can manage some complications and transfer immediately to a higher facility   if complications requiring surgery or blood transfusion develop. The list of   such institutions can be obtained from the ANM. The place should be clean   and safe and friendly and have a skilled nurse or doctor at all times. The   woman would have to stay there for 48 hours a� er delivery.  
3.  If there are no complications and mother and her family are reluctant or   unable to go to the 24x7 PHC or if it is too far away:  Advise the mother   could go the Sub-Centre, provided it is accredited as a delivery centre,   which means the ANM has been trained as a Skilled Birth A� endant (SBA),   and is available, and there are minimum facilities for delivery. 
4.  If there are no complications or not a high risk case for developing   complications and the mother and family insist on delivering at home,   despite counselling:  You could work with the ANM to enable a delivery   by SBA. This should be agreed to only if you are sure that the family can   organise transport and funds at very short notice. The SBA should be able   to arrive within 30 minutes of the onset of labour at the home/Sub-Centre   and should able to stay through the process of labour and for a few hours   a� erwards. A team of two or three women with experience in a� ending at   labour would be helpful. 
What does a birth preparedness plan contain?   (See Annexe-3 for format for individual plan) 
When should a birth preparedness plan be readied?  
It should be ready as early as possible a� er conﬁ rming the pregnancy, and   in consultation with the family (husband, mother-in-law, or other decision   makers). You should review the plan in the third trimester (a� er seventh   month) with the family and the ANM. At this time, the choice of institution   and the transport should be ﬁ nalised.
