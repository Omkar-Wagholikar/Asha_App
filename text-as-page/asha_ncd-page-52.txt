Steps of Breast Self-Examination (BSE) 

Five steps of BSE 

Step 1: Begin by looking at your breasts in the mirror with   shoulders straight and arms on hips. 
What to look for: 

Any change from the usual size, shape, and colour. 

Any visible distortion or swelling of the breast.  
If any of the following changes are seen, bring them to your   doctor's attention: 

Dimpling, puckering, or bulging of the skin. 

A nipple that has changed position or an inverted nipple   (pushed inward instead of sticking out). 

Redness, soreness, rash, or swelling. 
Step 2:  Same changes to be looked for with arms raised.  
Step 3:  Also look for any signs of fluid coming out of one or   both nipples (this could be a watery, milky, or yellow fluid or   blood). 
Step 4:  Next, feel breasts while lying down, using the right   hand to feel the left breast and then the left hand to feel the   right breast. Use a firm, smooth touch with the finger pads   of your hand, keeping the fingers flat and together. Use a   circular motion, about the size of a quarter. 
Cover the entire breast from top to bottom, side to side â€”   from your collarbone to the top of the abdomen, and from   the armpit to your cleavage. 

Follow a pattern to be sure that the whole breast is   covered.  

Begin at the nipple, moving in larger and larger circles   until the outer edge of the breast is reached.
