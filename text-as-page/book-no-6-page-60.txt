How to re-warm a baby getting cold? 
<97 degree Fahrenheit (36.1 degree Celsius) or too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit   (35.0 degree Celsius)  
Increase the room temperature. 
Remove any wet or cold blankets and clothes. 
Hold the baby with its skin next to its mother’s skin (skin-to-skin contact) and place a warmed cloth   (not too hot to avoid burns) on its back or chest. As this cloth cools down, replace it with another   warmed one, and repeat until the baby is warmer. Continue until the baby’s temperature reaches the   normal range. 
Put on its clothes and its cap, put it in warm bag, and make it lie close to its mother. 
Continue to breastfeed the baby to provide calories and fluids to prevent a drop in the blood glucose level. 

A common problem in hypothermic babies. 
If a baby is too cold <95 degree Fahrenheit (35.0 degree Celsius), follow the above advice, and 

Place skin-to-skin, and once the baby is a little warmer, then clothe baby and place in a bed pre-  warmed with warm clothes, or a hot stone or hot water bottle. (Remove these articles before putting   baby on the bed.) 
In an institutional delivery, there should be a newborn corner available with a radiant   warmer, or some other suitable heating arrangement where the newborn baby   can be kept.
