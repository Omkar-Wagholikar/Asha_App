What is Hypertension? 

Hypertension occurs when the blood moves through the blood vessels at a higher   pressure than normal. This requires the heart to work harder to push blood through the   blood vessels. This increases the load on the heart.  
Hypertension is also referred to as  “silent killer” . This is because it can exist without   causing any warning signs or symptoms. That is why it is important to screen all   individuals at least above the age of 30 years for blood pressure at least once annually. 
High blood pressure, if not controlled, may lead to damage of blood vessels, heart and   other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes. Constant high blood pressure can   cause life - threatening conditions, such as heart diseases and stroke, diabetes, kidney   diseases, etc. Reducing blood pressure to even a small extent can help lower the risk of   these conditions.
