As an ASHA, you need to keep the following points in  mind while communicating with stakeholders 

Give due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the      community or from the health care system. 

While sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you      prepare with the necessary information, data  and evidence. Never      generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not      want from them, what you want to change and what you want to      continue. 

Be calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety. 

Do not use a blaming tone. 
You will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will  affect those around you. And, of course, confidence and  assertiveness will help get your message through. A point to

Thank you
