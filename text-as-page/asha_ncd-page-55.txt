Screening of Oral Cancer 

Like other cancers, every individual (woman or man) of 30 years and above should be   screened by a trained provider, at least once in five years. Those who use tobacco in any   form should be encouraged to be screened more often. In the case of individuals who have   been using tobacco from a young age, they should be motivated to undergo examination   by a trained provider, even if they are not thirty years old.  
Screening for oral cancer can be done by a trained health workers such as an ANM at the   sub centre. This is called Oral Visual Examination.  
Oral cavity should be examined thoroughly using a mouth mirror and a white light. A   torch can be used for proper light. Any abnormal patch (white/red), ulcer, rough area,   granular area or swelling is to be considered for further examination at a referral facility.  

Self-examination can detect oral lesions at an early stage. 

All habitual tobacco users should do self-examination of oral cavity on a monthly   basis. 

Method of doing Self-examination of oral cavity:       Rinse the mouth with water and stand before a mirror in adequate light.       Normal oral cavity lining is soft and pink.        Look in the mirror for any abnormal white or red patch, ulcer or roughened area,   granular area or swelling in the mouth.       Consult a doctor if any abnormal area is found.
