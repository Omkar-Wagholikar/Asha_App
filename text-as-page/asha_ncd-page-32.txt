You have read in the earlier chapters that we are seeing changes in   life style related to eating habits, increasing consumption of tobacco,   alcohol and reduced physical activity. This has affected the nutritional   status leading to individuals becoming overweight.  
However, we also continue to see under nutrition not just among   children but among adult women and men as well in many parts   of the country. In your own area, you will see that there are both   undernourished individuals and people who are overweight.  
The common perception is that Non-Communicable Diseases occur   only in overweight individuals. However, undernourished women   are more likely to have low birth weight babies, who are at increased   risk of developing Non-Communicable Diseases when they grow into   adults. We have discussed this earlier.
