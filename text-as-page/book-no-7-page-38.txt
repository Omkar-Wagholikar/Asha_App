Safety:  Abortion is very safe if done by an experienced health worker. In India,   only a doctor can perform an abortion, and this should be done under clean   conditions, and with proper instruments.  
Abortion is o� en diﬃ  cult to get because, there are not enough service providers   and facilities. Those providers who do provide abortion services may charge a   lot of money or not even be legal providers of safe abortion services.  

If you are helping someone decide about an abortion 
She needs respectful advice and friendly support. Do not tell anyone else, not   even her family members, about her decision unless she wants others to know. 

Abortion is unsafe when it is done: 
By someone who has not been trained to do it. 
With the wrong instruments or medicines. 
Under unclean conditions. 
The later in pregnancy the abortion is undertaken, the more risky it becomes.  

Methods: All these methods can only be done by a trained,   legal provider 
 Medical Abortion:  This can be done only in very early pregnancies less   than seven weeks or 49 days a� er last missed period. The woman is   advised to take tablets, but this should be prescribed by and supervised by   a legal provider.  
 Manual Vacuum Aspiration:  This   method involves the woman staying in   the health facility for a few hours. It can   be done up to eight weeks of pregnancy.  
 Dilatation and cure� age (D and C):  This   method can be done up to 12 weeks of   pregnancy. It is associated with a higher risk of complications.  

Post-abortion care 

You should advise women  To avoid sex or pu� ing anything in the vagina for at least ﬁ ve days a� er the   abortion.  
Drink plenty of ﬂ uids for faster recovery.  
Some bleeding from vagina for up to two weeks is normal, but it should be   light. Next monthly period will be a� er 4-6 weeks.  
That the risk of pregnancy exists as soon as intercourse is resumed regardless   of monthly period. Therefore a contraceptive should be used.
