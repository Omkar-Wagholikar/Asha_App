Naturopathy and yoga systems provide various ways to keep the gastro-  intestinal tract in a good condition. Naturopathy teaches us to take the   foods, which are natural, easy to digest, absorb and eliminate. According   to naturopathy, nutritious and harmless food should be taken for proper   digestion, absorption and elimination. Hydrotherapy, mud therapy and   massage therapy helps to strengthen the digestive system and to eliminate   the toxins from the digestive system.
