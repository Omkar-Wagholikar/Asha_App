What is Cancer? 

Cancer is a disease caused by uncontrolled division of cells in any part of the body. This   causes abnormal growth of that part of the body. The cancer may also spread to more   distant parts of the body through the blood. There are various kinds of cancers that are   prevalent in our country. In this module, we are specifically going to address only the   three most commonly occurring cancers in India - cancer of the cervix and breast among   women and oral cancers in women and men. 
These three are commonly occurring cancers in India. Together, they account for   approximately 34% of all cancers in India. If these cancers are diagnosed early and treated   appropriately, chances of survival are good. Thus, regular screening programmes which   can diagnose cancers at early stages are an important preventive health programme.
