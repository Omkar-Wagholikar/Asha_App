f. Counselling tips 
You are there to help the mother, not to take over. 
Use verbal and non-verbal skills to make her feel at   ease. 
Encourage and praise her; every mother has the   ability to breastfeed. O en mothers are worried that   they are inexperienced and lack the con dence. Many   women do not breastfeed successfully because they   do not get good advice, support and encouragement. 
If she says something that you do not agree with, do not say that is   wrong. Do not make her feel bad or stupid. You can repeat what she says   (For example, I hear you saying that you think you dont have enough   milk.... Ask her why she thinks so. Listen to what she is saying and why).  
A er you assess the breastfeeding, you should check the babys weight   gain.  
Give advice in simple and clear language. 
Make sure the mother understands what you are saying. 
Have her repeat what she will try to do. 

g. Why only breastfeeding?  
Giving other food or  uid may harm the baby in following ways 
It reduces the amount of breast milk taken by the baby. 
It may contain germs from water or on feeding bo les or utensils. These   germs can cause diarrhoea. 
It may be too dilute, so the baby becomes malnourished. 
Baby does not get enough iron from cows and goats milk and may thus   develop anaemia. 
Baby may develop allergies. 
Baby may have di  culty digesting animal milk; the milk can cause   diarrhoea, rashes or other symptoms. Diarrhoea may become persistent.  
Breast milk provides all the water a baby needs. Babies do not need extra   water even during the summer months.
