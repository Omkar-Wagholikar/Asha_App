First aid in any snake bite 
Reassure the person and the family. Tell them it may be non-poisonous. Make  the person lie down and relax. Do not make patient walk. . In case of non  poisonous snake bite, it s enough to clean and disinfect the wound. 
Tie the entire limb with an elastic bandage. This slows blood flow from the limb.  Then tie a stick to the limb to lessen movement. 
Shift to the nearest hospital. Keep looking for poison signs of drooping or  bleeding. Take along the snake if it is brought killed. This helps in  treatment. Now specific anti snake venous infections are available. You  should know about the hospitals where anti snake venom drugs are  available in your area. 
Many people kill snakes indiscriminately. This is not good. Snakes eats  rodents which causes loss of our food grains. And many of them are  non-poisonous. 

Don'ts 

Do not waste valuable time in a temple or with a Tantrik. Remember even  some Tantriks have died due to snakebite. 

Do not tie a tourniquet (single band string as was practiced till sometime  ago). This causes the bite to bleed and may also stop blood flow to the limb.  More than 2 hours to tight tourniquet can cause blackening and then loss  of the limb. 

Do not kill and waste chickens as some villagers do to treat snake bite. 

What do you think about this? 

Some people kill every snake they see. 

Snakes eat up rats and save our food grain. 

Snakes remember and identify a person.
