Give the baby a lot of watery foods like ‘Sharbat’, coconut water, rice-kanji,  light tea etc. You should talk about commonly available, locally accepted  liquids which are given to children. 

Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) 
ORS packets are available in your kit and with other health workers. 
Take one liter of water in a clean container. Empty the full packet of ORS in  this. Stir it. Start giving this fluid spoon by spoon to the child. Prepare fresh  ORS everyday. 

Other tips 

Mother/father or other care taker, should wash hand properly before  feeding the baby. It should not give new infection. 

Give ORS spoon by spoon to avoid vomiting. 

If possible, use boiled water for preparing ORS. At least make sure it is from  safe sources. 

Continue breastfeeding if the baby is breastfeeding. 

Give other foods and drinks along with ORS. 

Bottle feeding is bad for any child. Avoid it in diarrhea also.
