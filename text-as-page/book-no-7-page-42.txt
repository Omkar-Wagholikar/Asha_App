Pills should not be advised for women who are breastfeeding.  
OCP are available in your drug kit, and at the Sub-Centre, Primary Health   Centre (PHC) and Community Health Centre (CHC).  
Emergency Contraceptive Pills  ASHA does not start women on a pill, but could provide follow-up once   it is started. These  are for emergency use, when the couple has not used a   contraceptive and have had unprotected sex. It can also be used in instances   of rape, or accidental breaking of the condom. The woman must take the   pill as soon as possible a� er unprotected sex. The pills are eﬀ ective within   12- 24 hours of intercourse. The pills will not work if the woman has already   become pregnant from having sex more than three days earlier. These pills   are available in your drug kit, at the Sub-Centre, PHC and CHC. These pills   are to be used only as an emergency method and you should advise users to   shi�  to regular methods of family planning. 
Condom:  The condom is a narrow bag of thin rubber that the man wears on   his penis during sex. Because the man’s semen stays in the bag, the sperm   cannot enter the woman’s body, and she cannot get pregnant. The condom is   a useful device to be used as a contraceptive and to protect against Sexually   Transmi� ed Infections (STIs) and HIV. It is also useful for couples where the   male is a migrant and returns home for short durations. 
Men most o� en buy condoms from shops. Since you have a supply of   condoms in your drug kit, women may feel more conﬁ dent in approaching   you to obtain condoms.  
The Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD, Copper-T, the Loop)  The IUCD is a small object or device that is inserted into the uterus and   prevents the man’s sperm from fertilising the woman’s egg. The IUCD can   stay in the uterus for up to 10 years. The most common IUCDs are made of   copper.  
Remember: 

A condom is to be used every time the woman has a   sexual encounter to prevent from pregnancy, STIs   and HIV.  

A condom is to be used only once. A condom that has   been used before is more likely to break. 

Condoms are to be kept in a cool, dry place away from   sunlight. Condoms that are from old or torn package are   more likely to break.
