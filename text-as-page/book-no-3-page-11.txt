Children 

If a woman has children too close i.e. less than 36 months interval,   her own health and her childrens health suffer. 

Family with fewer children will be able to take better care of them,   including their educational attainments, growth and development.  

Other benefits 

Some contraceptives i.e. condoms (both male and female condom) help   in protecting against infections of genital tract including HIV/AIDS as   well as preventing unwanted pregnancies. 

Some methods are good to regulate irregular bleeding from uterus. 

Use of family planning methods will allow women to exercise their   right over their own bodies. If they do not wish to have more children   then they can use contraceptives with discretion.  

Different family planning methods 
Pregnancies are caused by the union of egg produced by the woman and   the sperm by the man. The egg (which later grows into a baby after union   with the sperm) is produced inside the womb of the woman. When a sexual   union between man and woman takes place, sperms released to the vagina   of woman swim toward the egg in the womb. Union of egg and one of the   sperms results in pregnancy. The walls of the womb provide nourishment   to the egg. The egg unites with the sperm and grows into a baby.  
There are five main types of family planning methods:  
Barrier methods  If the sperm does not reach the egg, pregnancy can be avoided. For   example, when a man uses a condom, the sperm remains inside the   condom only. Therefore, the sperms are not able to reach the egg inside   the womb. Thus pregnancy is prevented.  

Man  Sperm 
Egg  Woman 
Sperm enters the egg   and unites with it  Fetus, which grows into   a baby 

Hormonal methods  This prevents the womans   ovary from releasing an egg,   make it harder for the sperm   to reach the egg, and keep   the lining of the womb from   supporting a pregnancy. For   example Mala N tablets.
