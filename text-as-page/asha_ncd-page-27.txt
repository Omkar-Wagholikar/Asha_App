Poverty as an underlying cause for unhealthy food choices  

Most information that is available through advertisements and newspapers, highlight   that unhealthy foods (foods particularly rich in fats, sugars and salt). are the reasons for   causing NCDs. They also urge people to eat more fruits, nuts and vegetables, eat more   often, and use healthy oils in their cooking.  
These messages assume that such healthy foods are easily available to everyone, and that   people have the time and money to purchase and prepare healthy foods. 
However, poor people are unable to afford such dietary items on a regular basis.. Poor   people tend to eat larger quantities of foods that are cheap but do not have much   nutritional value. For instance, you will find people eating five or six chapattis, but with   hardly any vegetables or only watery dal. Among rice eating communities, poor people   cannot afford pulses and vegetables so they may eat a large quantity of rice, with just a   little dal or buttermilk.  
Also, in rural areas, poor people may farm on plots of borrowed land. Even though they   cultivate healthy grains/pulses or fruits and vegetables the major share of the harvest is   taken away by the landowners. 
Over the past few decades several environmental factors, changes in farming practices   (farmers are no longer cultivating traditional grains and have shifted to wheat/rice   cultivation) and food marketing strategies have affected the quality of diets. It has also   resulted in decreased consumption of locally and regionally available foods which are   nutritionally adequate (rich in all vital nutrients). All these changes have a higher adverse   affect on the poor.
