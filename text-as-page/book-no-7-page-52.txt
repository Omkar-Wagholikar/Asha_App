What should you do if the baby is at high risk? 
Increase the number of home visits a� er delivery from 5 to 13.  
A daily visit, if possible, for the ﬁ rst week.  
Once every three days until the baby is 28 days old, and if the baby is   improving once on the 42
nd
 day.  
Weigh the babies on Day 7, 14, 21, 28. Babies who weigh less than 2300   gm on the 28
th
 day have a higher risk of dying. If the baby is not gaining   weight, refer the baby to the hospital.  
Explain the high risk issues to the parents and family (see box above). 
Provide speciﬁ c care as per the problem but in general, keep the baby   warm and breastfeed more o� en every two hours. 
For poor breastfeeding, observe the mother breastfeeding. Ensure proper   latch on and positioning. Encourage the mother so that she is motivated   to feed the baby well. Counsel the mother that she should not give other   liquids or feeds. 
If on Day 28 the weight is less than 2300 gm or weight gain in 28 days is   less than 300 gm, then you should continue to visit once a week in the   2
nd
 month and take the weight every week.

Guidance that you should give to the family 


Keep the baby clothed from the very first day. In winter, cover the baby with a   blanket. 


Do  not bathe a baby until its weight is 2000 
gm. 

Ensure that mother’s nails are cut and that her hands are washed every time   the baby is breastfed. 


After returning from the toilet, all family members must wash their hands with   soap before touching the baby. 


High risk babies should be breastfed after every two hours. 


If baby is not suckling milk, squeeze the breast milk in a small bowl and then   feed the baby with a spoon. 


The weight of high risk babies should improve every week from second week.   If this does not happen, counsel them to consult you. 


Ask them to call you immediately if the baby develops any of the following:   All limbs become limp, stops feeding, has chest indrawing, has fever, and is   cold to touch.
