11 

Fever is a common symptom of many diseases, which may be simple or   serious. Some mild fevers subside without any treatment/treatment at   home e.g. fever with no cough/running nose/ear discharge/with no rash/  without diarrhoea/without any obvious infection etc. However, in many   children it may be a symptom of an acute severe illness. For fever in   children a blood smear examination should be done.  

Temperature and fever 
Our body is warm both in summer and winter. When   it is very hot outside, our body perspires. It releases   water and cools like an earthen pot. When it is very   cold outside our body shivers to generate heat. In all   seasons our body remains warm enough to maintain all   its functions. The normal body temperature is just above   36

C or 98
0
F. 
After an attack by germs, our body works very fast. It generates more   heat and hence fever. But excess fever may be harmful and lead to several   complications.
