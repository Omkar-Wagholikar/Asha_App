Who is at higher risk? : In areas where malaria is highly prevalent, pregnant   mothers and malnourished children are at greater risk. 
How to suspect malaria : Any person living in a malaria aﬀ ected area, who   develops fever must be suspected as having malaria. If fever is with chills and   rigor and headache, it is even more likely.  
How to conﬁ rm:  There are two ways of conﬁ rming malaria: 
Using the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit the patient’s blood can be tested   for malaria (Please see Annexe 4). If the test is positive then the patient   has malaria.  
You should also make a blood smear. (Please see Annexe 5). The parasite   can be seen in the blood smear Sometimes the blood smears can be   negative, and a repeat smear is required.  
  RDT and Smears are to be taken before starting treatment. All ASHAs   working in a block with a high incidence of malaria need to be trained for   taking smears for malaria.  

Treating Malaria 
1. Give paracetamol for fever. Also sponging with warm water to bring   down temperature when needed. 
2. If RDT is positive for malaria- Give chloroquine or Artesunate   Combination treatment (ACT) drug as recommended. (Annexe 7) The   dose of the drug depends of the age group. The exact dosage schedule is   given in Annexe 6. Nowadays the recommendation is to treat for malaria   only if the test is positive. If the test is not available, or cannot be done, it   is permissible to give a course of chloroquine. This would still be needed   in many areas.  
3. If despite treatment fever does not begin to come down within two or   three days, or persists even a� er a week, referral becomes mandatory.  

Referral to ANM or doctor is necessary if there is no response and fever continues   or if patient becomes delirious.  

Prevention of Malaria 
Mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet climates. There   are many types of mosquitoes, but only very few of   them transmit the disease. The mosquito that transmits   malaria is called Anopheles and it bites almost   exclusively at night. It does not bite during the day.   That is why sleeping under a bed net is a good way of   preventing bites. The mosquito that spreads malaria   breeds in clean water. That is why during rainy season,   where water collects, this forms a good breeding place   for mosquitoes.
