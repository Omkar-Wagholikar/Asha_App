First aid and other help 
First try to put out the flames. The   immediate first aid for all kinds of   burns is to pour plenty of cold water   on the affected part, except on acid   burns. This helps to reduce damage   by absorbing heat from the skin. It   also reduces pain to some extent.   Water also helps by separating   burning clothes from the skin.  
Many people wrongly believe that   water causes blisters on the skin   and instead they wrap the victim   in blankets. This puts the fire off   after some seconds, but does not   absorb the heat. Water is far more effective than a blanket because   it cools instantly. 
If you are using water-soaked folds of clothes, place them on the burnt   part and change them every three minutes. Help the victim to drink as   much water as possible. This helps to overcome the shock caused by fluid   loss from the body. Cover the burns with a clean cloth to protect from   dust, flies, etc. Unless the burns are minor, all burn cases must be referred   to hospitals. Facial burns and burn in hands should be referred. 
You may have to treat small burns at home. Treat it like any other wound.   Herbal applications like neem oil, coconut oil, aloe or raw papaya dressings   are good.  

Prevention of burns 
Prevention is better than cure. Think and start from your own home.   Synthetic clothes catch fire quite quickly. They stick to the skin more
