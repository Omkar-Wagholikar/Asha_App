To have one of these operations, the woman must go to a PHC or CHC.   The surgery is fast and safe, and does not cause side-eﬀ ects.  
The services for sterilisation are provided on certain days in these centres.   You must know the nearest site where this service is available and on   what days.  
When needed, the ASHA could accompany the woman to the facility for   the tubectomy procedure. O� en because of the case overload, quality of   services is not assured and the ASHA should help the woman receive   good quality care. Accompanying is desirable, but not mendatory. 
The operation for the man (Vasectomy)  A vasectomy is a simple operation, with only a small puncture   to block the tubes that carry the sperm. It takes only a few   minutes to do.  The operation does not change a man’s ability   to have sex or to feel sexual pleasure . He still ejaculates   semen but there are no sperm in the semen. The couple must   be advised to use condoms or other contraceptives for 90 days following   vasectomy.  
The operation for the woman (Tubectomy)   A tubal ligation is a slightly more diﬃ  cult operation than a   vasectomy, but it is still very safe. It takes about 30 minutes.   A trained doctor makes a small cut in the woman’s abdomen,   and then cuts or ties the tubes that carry the egg to the womb.   The woman can have the operation within seven days of the   start of the menstrual cycle, 24 hours a� er delivery, or six weeks a� er the   delivery.  

Important  
Sterilisation and pills do not protect against STIs and Human Immuno-deficiency   Virus (HIV). So, for protection from STIs and HIV, a condom should be used   during every sexual intercourse, if the woman is at risk of contracting them.
