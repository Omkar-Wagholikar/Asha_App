Screening of Cervical Cancer 

Screening would normally be undertaken at a Primary health Centre or Community   health Centre by a trained doctor or by a trained nurse or by a gynaecologist. Screening or   regular check-ups for cervical cancer are important, since during the early stages, women   may experience no symptoms. Cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable   cancers when detected at early stage. A common method for screening cancer is VIA   (Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid).  
Screening should be done in a separate room   from regular OPD, and if a separate room is   not available then a curtain should be used   to maintain privacy. 

Approximately   30   women   can   be   screened in a day, so screening should   be planned accordingly. 

Once an abnormality is detected, the   individual should be referred to a   gynaecologist.  

Your role is to mobilise all women over   30 years of age to be screened at least   once in five years. For those women with   a family history or those who develop   these symptoms at any time, this should   be done as soon as possible. Such   patients should be referred to a health   facility at any time.
