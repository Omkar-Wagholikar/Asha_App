Some tips to play your role as an effective coordinator of  a village meeting 

As an ASHA you have to prepare adequately before meeting. Personally  meet the participants beforehand and inform them about the agenda of  the meeting. Have clarity on what you are going to discuss. You should also  be well aware about the complexity of the issue. 

You should be able to judge what will be the reaction of the other  person when you discuss the issue with her or him. Be prepared with the  counter-arguments. 

While having the discussion listen and observe carefully. Any change in a  personâ€™s expression communicate a lot.
