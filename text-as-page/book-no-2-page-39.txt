Iodine deficiency 
Iodine is a very important trace element. It is required for the normal growth   and development of human beings. Its deficiency during pregnancy can   lead to spontaneous abortion/still birth and cretinism/mental retardation   in children. 
You should advise the pregnant women to take iodized salt in food, which   is enough to prevent the iodine deficiency.
