example, is the child able to take  uid into his mouth and swallow it? If you   are not sure about the mothers answer, ask her to o er the child a drink of   clean water or breast milk. Look to see if the child is swallowing the water   or breast milk. A child who is breastfed may have di  culty sucking when   his nose is blocked. If the childs nose is blocked, clear it. If the child can   breastfeed a er his nose is cleared, the child does not have the danger sign.  
Step 2: ASK : Does the child vomit everything?  A child who is not able to hold anything down at all has the sign vomits   everything. What goes down comes back up. A child who vomits   everything will not be able to hold down food,  uids or oral drugs. A child   who vomits several times but can hold down some  uids does not have this   general danger sign. 
Step 3: ASK: Has the child had convulsions?  Ask the mother questions on whether the child has   su ered from convulsions (local term) or not.  
Step 4: LOOK: See if the child is lethargic or   unconscious.  The lethargic child is sleepy when the child should be awake. A child who   stares blankly and does not appear to notice what is happening around is   also lethargic. 
The unconscious child does not waken at all. This child does not respond to   touch, loud noise or pain. 
Step 5: Ensure that the child is referred to a PHC/CHC immediately. 
Remember:  
 All sick children must be assessed for general danger   signs.  A child who has even one general danger sign has a   severe problem. Refer this child urgently to hospital.   Complete the rest of the assessment and any pre-referral   treatment immediately so that referral is not delayed. 
If child has diarrhoea, cough and/or cold, or fever, without any of the   danger signs, the next three chapters describe how to proceed.
