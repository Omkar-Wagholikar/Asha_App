Understanding about Tuberculosis 
A minute germ causes TB. It spreads from one person to  other through breath. A TB patient’s sputum has  thousands of TB germs. Also while coughing or sneezing  the germs spread in the air. The germs also stay in dust  for long and affect people. TB germs enter the lungs of  nearby persons. In a weak person the germs survive and  produce an illness. It may take months. 
TB can affect any part of our body. But Chest TB  is the most important. It spreads from one  person to other through air. 
TB is serious illness. Any one, rich or  poor, adults’ male or female and  children can suffer from TB. Under  nutrition,   weak   immunity,  overcrowding   and   poor   living  conditions etc. help Tuberculosis  spread.
