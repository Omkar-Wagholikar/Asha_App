Dai:  In each village you will come to know  about Dai ma. There may be more than  one   dai   ma  in a village.  Dais conduct child birth, although it is not  possible for them to manage women  when there are difficulties during child  birth. You need to develop rapport with  dais in your village. Try to find out them  if they have undergone any training in  past. We will know more about Dai in  following chapter.
