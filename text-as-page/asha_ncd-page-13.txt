Importance of Health Promotion   |    5 

Health promotion is thus about eating healthy food, avoiding unhealthy food, and   ensuring positive social, environmental and occupational conditions so that where one   lives and works plays a major role towards health and wellbeing of an individual. However,   when giving people advice about health promotion, you must understand their current   lifestyles and be sensitive to their specific needs. 
There are wide health gaps between the rich and poor in India, so a single health promotion   programme will not fit everybody. Health promotion messages should be adapted to the   local needs of the community and take into account different behaviours and lifestyles.  

For example:  Asking a construction worker to exercise daily for 30 minutes is not a   good advice as she/he is already engaged in active physical work throughout the day.   Ensuring a safe working environment, preventing work place related accidents, safe   drinking water and sanitation should be a priority for her/his health and wellbeing. 
For example:  Recommending expensive dietary options to those who cannot afford   to have even one full meal a day is being insensitive to realities of poor peopleâ€™s   lives. However, encouraging people to consume traditional foods that are locally   available would meet their nutritional needs without imposing high costs. 

Healthy living include healthy   eating,   physical   activities,   good personal hygiene, weight   management, stress management,   avoiding tobacco, drugs, and the   harmful use of alcohol.
