Child Health & Nutrition 

One-third of the worlds undernourished children live in India. About 46%   of the children below three years in India are underweight. This means   that roughly one out of two children weigh less than they should for their   age. Under nutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic   performance, reduced work capacity, and poor health and nutrition status   through childhood, adolescence and adulthood. 

Facts about Malnutrition in Young Children 
Malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease. Malnutrition is one of the   contributory factors to over half of all child deaths. 
Malnutrition is highly related to poverty. Poor families have less money to   spend to get the quantity and variety of food, they  nd it more di  cult to   get healthcare and also there is less time for child care.  
Counselling can help the family in making the right choices on using   their scarce resources to feed their children and protect them from   malnutrition.  
Families are more comfortable when issues of feeding are discussed in   their homes. Also at the home, not only the mother, but the father and the   grandparents of the child, all become part of the dialogue.
