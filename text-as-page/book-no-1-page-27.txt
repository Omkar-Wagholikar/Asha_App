Our Mouth and teeth 
Our teeth remain healthy if we clean them everyday. Food particles collect in  the tooth gaps. This leads to tooth problems and swollen gums. 
We must have a good mouthwash after each meal. This will remove food  particles and prevent the problems of tooth and gums. Just imagine what  happens to a utensil, which was used for cooking food last night and not  cleaned overnight. It stinks badly. Similarly if we donâ€™t clean our mouth after  meals it will also stink. Never have a bed-tea without mouthwash.

Brush at least twice every day, before and  after sleep. This would prevent plaque formation. 
Brushing too vigorously or using a hard brush may cause damage to gums. 
Change the brush if the bristles look spread. A worn out toothbrush will not  clean our teeth. 
Toothpaste is not always necessary for brushing. Therefore brushing is a cheap  way to keep the teeth and gums healthy.
