Newborn Care  

5 

Every newborn needs certain essential elements of care immediately at   birth and the first 28 days of life, irrespective of mode of delivery/weight   of baby. It is important because for every 10 babies who die during the   first year, five babies die in the first 28 days of their life.  

Skin to skin contact 
Provide privacy to the mother. Request the mother to sit or recline   comfortably. Undress the baby gently, except for cap, nappy and socks.   Place the baby prone on mother’s chest in an upright and extended posture,   between her breasts, in skin-to-skin contact; turn baby’s head to one side   to keep airways clear. Cover the baby with mother’s blouse, ‘pallu’ or gown;   wrap the baby-mother together with an added blanket or shawl.  

When the skin-to-skin contact is not possible clothe the baby in one-  two layers (in summer), three-four layers (in winter) and cover the   head & feet with cap and socks respectively. Let the baby and mother   lie together on soft, thick bedding and cover them with additional   quilt, blanket or shawl in winter. 

The baby should not be given bath immediately after birth. 

Advise the family that baby should be referred immediately to FRU if   the baby has any of these signs:
