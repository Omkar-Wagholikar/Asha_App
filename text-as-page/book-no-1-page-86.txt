Child feeding practices after six months 

After six months of only breast feeding, the baby needs extra food to grow.  Start one new food type at a time, not many. 

Food like gruel, porridge, cooked vegetable, fruit pulp is  good for babies after six months age. If top milk is given do  not dilute it. Dilute milk is often the cause of malnutrition. 

Prepare semi solid feeds from roasted, puffed grain, flour  prepared from fermented grain (satva) are easy to digest. 

Add oil or ghee to childâ€™s food to improve nutrition. 

Eggs are a good source of body building element  called proteins. 

Babies and children need frequent feeds every day. Child  should be offered food every three to four hours. 

Washing hands before preparing food and feeding child is essential. 

For older children (2 years) keep food ready and reachable for the child. The  child should it eat whenever hungry e.g. Roasted groundnuts and Jaggery  (gud) are popular. 

Eggs, groundnut, Soyabeans, fish are high protein foods. Child growth is  better with these feeds.
