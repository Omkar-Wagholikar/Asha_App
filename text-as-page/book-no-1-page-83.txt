Breast feeding –It is important to share this advice  with mothers 
Immediate breast feeding within half an hour after birth is vital for the baby. It  gives baby nutrition and immunity against illnesses. It shrinks the mother’s  womb and reduce bleeding. Milk flow is better with frequent suckling. 
Breast milk is the best food for the baby till 6 months. No other feeds including  water are necessary. Consult a Nursedidi if a mother has any breastfeeding  problem even after your help. 
Mother’s breasts get prepared for producing milk during pregnancy. On delivery  the breasts are ready to secrete thick milk called colostrum. The baby should be  fed with colostrum as it protects the baby from germ-attacks. This should not  be thrown away. 
Breast milk provides for all the needs of the baby. It also  contains sufficient water for the baby’s needs. No need for  feeding water separately. More the baby suckles, the more  milk is produced.
