Immunizing dogs 
Immunization of dogs is essential. The protection given by vaccines used   in the government veterinary services lasts for six months. Protection   by newer vaccines lasts for one year. Those who handle dogs also need   immunization every six months. A common problem is whether to use the   milk of an animal bitten by a suspected dog or animal. The rabies germ is   not reported in the milk of animals. It is completely destroyed by boiling,   so milk of such animals is not harmful. However, the saliva of the animal   will contain germs if infected by rabies. The key issue is to avoid direct   contact of saliva of such animals. 

Your role and responsibilities :

Refer all cases of dog/other animal bites to facility where an anti-rabies   vaccine is available.
