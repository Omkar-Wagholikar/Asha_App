Waste water an asset, not a health hazard 
Pools and streams of wastewater are common scene in a village. Nobody  likes it. This dirty wastewater is from our baths, kitchens and cattle-  shades. Mosquitoes breed in such stagnated pools. They give us sleepless  nights and malaria fever. Many deaths occur due to  malaria, and many more fall sick and suffer. Malaria fever  increases risk of abortions. Some other illnesses also  spread due to mosquitoes. We can avoid all this at little  cost and effort. 
Wastewater pools also stink. They make life difficult for those  staying nearby. 
It is a hazard for small children. Children can fall in these  cesspools and hurt themselves. 
We can put the wastewater to good use for a kitchen garden.  This will enrich our meals and avoid sleep less nights. If kitchen garden is not  possible we can dispose wastewater through a soak pit.
