Annexe 2: Instructions for Pregnancy   Test using Nischay Kit 

The Nischay Kit contains the following: 
1. A test card 
2. A disposable dropper 
3. A moisture absorption packet (not required for testing) 
•  Collect the morning urine in a clean and   dry glass or in a plastic bottle.  •  Take two drops of urine in the sample   well.  •  Wait for 5 minutes. 
•  If two violet colour lines come in the test   region (T), the woman is pregnant.  •  If she wants to continue with the   pregnancy, advise her to undergo   antenatal care.  •  If she does not want to continue with the   pregnancy this time, advise her for safe   abortion. 
•  If the violet colour line in the test   region (T) is one only, the woman is not   pregnant.  •  Tell her about family planning methods   and help her in choosing the most   appropriate one. 
If there is no colour line in the test region   (T), repeat the test next morning using a   new Pregnancy Test Card.
