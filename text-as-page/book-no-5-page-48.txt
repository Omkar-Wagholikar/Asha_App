Although everyone negotiates informally all the time without even being  aware of it, formal negotiation is a skill that can be learned through  experience and practice. People who negotiate a lot tend to be much more  skilled at it than people who have not participated in any formal  negotiation. Negotiation means dealing with differences between two or  more individuals or groups. As an ASHA you will have to deal with differences.  You have  to resolve these differences to achieve the larger goals of village  health programmes. Let us build an understanding of the process of  negotiation. 
Negotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different  needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue.  Because negotiating is an inter-personal process, each negotiating situation is  different, and is influenced by each partys skills, attitudes and style. We  often look at negotiating as unpleasant because it implies conflict, but  negotiating need not be characterised by bad feelings or angry behavior.  Understanding more about the negotiation process allows us to manage our  negotiations with confidence and increases the chance that the outcomes will  be positive for both parties. 
Negotiations need not be confrontational by being offensive, insulting and  challenging. In fact, effective negotiation is characterised by  groups working  together to find a solution, rather than each group trying to WIN at any cost.
