All members of the village are allowed to attend the Gram Panchayat.  Are your attending the Gram Panchayat? 

No one in your village is subjected to degrading treatment or punishment. 

My village Panchayat has people from diverse backgrounds, religion and  cultures. There are some women members in our Panchayat. There are  33% seats reserved in the Panchayat for women. 

I can express my  political, religious and cultural ideas and beliefs to my  family and community without fear of discrimination. 

Members of my village actively participate in decision-making processes  related to village and community development through the village Gram  Sabha. 

The village members and labourers are paid as per minimum wage norms. 

Both men and women are paid equal wages for equal work.
