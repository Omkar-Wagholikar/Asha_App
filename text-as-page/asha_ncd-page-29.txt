Enabling Adequate and Regular Physical Activity in    your Community  

Members of a Self-Help Group in Tamil Nadu decided that   they would meet every day at 7 pm when they had finished   their household chores. Together they would walk to the village   boundary which is nearly 2 km away. They also learnt yoga from   a TV show and practiced it three times a week. 
As seen from this example, given below are some ideas for people   who do not engage in regular physical activity: 

l
 Choose an activity that fits into daily routine. 

l 
Find time for exercise and make it a routine.  

l
 Exercising in groups improves motivation to exercise. 

Please Note:  People suffering from heart problem, person with disabilities,   pregnant women, or lactating women, and those with other health issues may   need to do different amount and types of exercises to suit their condition.   They should receive advice on this from the nurse or the Medical Officer at   the PHC.  

Exercise should increase the heart rate. Household activities like sweeping, cleaning,   washing, dusting, etc. do contribute to physical activity. However, doing only such   household work alone may not meet the daily requirements.  
Advice on physical activity should be given according to the occupation and life style of   individuals. For example, those who spend long hours in strenuous physical work such as   working in the fields or as labourers, or carrying heavy loads may not need to engage in   further physical activity.
