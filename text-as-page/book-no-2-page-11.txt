READING MATERIAL FOR ASHA 

anything to make sure that either a boy or girl is born – this happens   completely by chance inside the woman’s body depending on whether a   boy-sperm (XY) or girl-sperm (XX) meet with the egg. Hence it is wrong to   blame a woman for not giving birth to a baby boy, as is generally done. 

Roles and responsibilities of ASHA: 
As ASHA, you may come across some couples in your village who have no   children, or the woman is unable to get pregnant after one or two abortions. If   the woman is 20 years of age or above and has been living with her husband   for two years, leading a normal marital life but has not become pregnant,   advise the couple to consult a nurse or directly go for a check-up to a doctor.   Both partners must go together for infertility treatment as either or both of   them may be having some problem, which needs treatment. Please note that   couples often live apart because one of them has migrated in search of a job.   It may be difficult for such couples to have a baby.  
It is also possible that women are being blamed for having only girls. Some   women may be deserted by their husbands and families for not producing a   son. You should clearly communicate the role of men and women in deciding   the sex of a baby.
